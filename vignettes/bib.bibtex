abstract = {The usefulness and relevance of size-based indicators (SBIs) to an ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF) are assessed through a review of empirical and modelling studies. SBIs are tabulated along with their definitions, data requirements, potential biases, availability of time-series, and expected directions of change in response to fishing pressure. They include mean length in a population, mean length in a community, mean maximum length in a community, and the slope and intercept of size spectra. Most SBIs can be derived from fairly standard survey data on length frequencies, without the need for elaborate models. Possible fishing- and environment-induced effects are analysed to distinguish between the two causes, and hypothetical cases of reference directions of change are tabulated. We conclude that no single SBI can serve as an effective overall indicator of heavy fishing pressure. Rather, suites of SBI should be selected, and reference directions may be more useful than reference points. Further modelling and worldwide comparative studies are needed to provide better understanding of SBIs and the factors affecting them. The slow response to fishing pressure reflects the complexity of community interactions and ecosystem responses, and prohibits their application in the context of short-term (annual) tactical fisheries management. However, movement towards longer-term (5e10 years) strategic management in EAF should facilitate their use.},

@article{Pope1994,
abstract = {All ecosystems require constituent species to survive against a backcloth of biotic and abiotic scenery. How this scenery shapes the life-history strategies of the players and how they in turn shape the scenery are important themes of the play of life. Species surviving in temperate and Arctic shelf seas do so against a scenery dominated by seasonal changes in the size-spectrum of other players. Successful survival in such an environment requires species to ride the big wave of annual productivity as it rolls through the extended size spectrum from phytoplankton to large fish. This wave flattens and broadens as it moves towards higher sizes. We speculate that in a seasonal shelf seas environment the wave shape is such that the Sheldon-Sutcliffe spectrum of equal biomass per log size interval is approximately true as an annual average although it may not be true at any particular moment in the year. Such spectra are structured by biomass being moved up the size spectrum mainly by predation processes, with growth of individuals being a second order process. However, the problem for an individual is to grow up through a size spectrum from its size at birth to its size at reproduction. Hence species need to find survival paths through the fluctuating scenery. This scenery is composed of the biomass of the prey, that of animals of a similar size, and larger predators. The paths followed dictate the life-history strategies of the species. This central problem for sea dwellers in temperate and Arctic shelf seas generates a broad similarity in the choice of life-history strategy for many key players over quite wide geographic areas of the globe. In these seas, strategies of high fecundity, high mortality and high growth rate are particularly common while strategies of low fecundity and parental care are rare for much of the size range. These seas also seem to favour longer trophic chains than terrestrial systems and either several generations per year or multiannual life cycles rather than annual cycles.},

abstract = {Most fish species (and sometimes different life stages within a species) exhibit behavioral temperature selection. In nature, thermal gradients provide habitat structure to which fish orient. Apparently, fish have evolved to fit into 'thermal niches' to optimize physiological, ecological, and reproductive performance in their native habitats. However, man has perturbed many of these habitats to the point where previously advantageous thermal preference behaviour may now be inapropriate. Termal perturbations are the most obviously related examples of man's interference, but fish's inherent thermal preference can magnify the biologcial effects of changes in dissolved oxygen, food supply, toxicants and physical barriers. Environmental management should (1) consider thermal preference behavior when evaluating habitat (2) manage for needed temperature and thermal structure, and (3) give priority attention minimizing degradation of preferred thermal habitat, especially when it is in short supply.},

abstract = {In order to provide better fisheries management and conservation decisions, there is a need to discern the underlying relationship between the spawning stock and recruitment of marine fishes, a relationship which is influenced by the environmental conditions. Here, we demonstrate how the environmental conditions (temperature and the food availability for fish larvae) influence the stock-recruitment relationship and indeed what kind of stock-recruitment relationship we might see under different environmental conditions. Using unique zooplankton data from the Continuous Plankton Recorder, we find that food availability (i.e. zooplankton) in essence determines which model applies for the once large North Sea cod (Gadus morhua) stock. Further, we show that recruitment is strengthened during cold years and weakened during warm years. Our combined model explained 45 per cent of the total variance in cod recruitment, while the traditional Ricker and Beverton-Holt models only explained about 10 per cent. Specifically, our approach predicts that a full recovery of the North Sea cod stock might not be expected until the environment becomes more favourable.},

abstract = {Environmentally induced change appears to be impacting the recruitment of North Sea herring (Clupea harengus). Despite simultaneously having a large adult population, historically low exploitation, and Marine Stewardship Council accreditation (implying sustainability), there have been an unprecedented 6 sequential years of poor juvenile production (recruitment). Analysis suggests that the poor recruitment arises during the larval overwintering phase, with recent survival rates greatly reduced. Contemporary warming of the North Sea has caused significant changes in the plankton community, and a recently identified regime shift around 2000 shows close temporal agreement with the reduced larval survival. It is, therefore, possible that we are observing the first consequences of this planktonic change for higher trophic levels. There is no indication of a recovery in recruitment in the short term. Fishing mortality is currently outside the agreed management plan, and forecasts show a high risk of the stock moving outside safe biological limits soon, potentially precipitating another collapse of the stock. However, bringing the realized fishing mortality back in line with the management plan would likely alleviate the problem. This illustrates again that recruitment is influenced by more than just spawning-stock biomass, and that changes in other factors can be of equal, or even greater, importance. In such dynamically changing environments, recent management success does not necessarily guarantee future sustainability.},

Earlier studies on length and age at maturity, von Bertalanffy growth formula parameters, natural mortality and maximum age for clupeiformes, pleuronectiformes. gadiformes and Sebastes spp. are up-dated and extended. The concept of the Growth-Maturity-Longevity (GML) plot is developed and applied. GML plots for the gadi- formes and pleuronectiformes occupy the same two-dimensional space, but those for clupeiformes and Sehasres are located differently from them and from each other. The GML parameter suite for long-lived Sebastes spp. is similar to that of certain higher vertebrates of comparable longevity (minke whale and African elephant). It is suggested that the conventional distinction between the growth of fish being indeterminate and that for higher vertebrates determinate is inappropriate; the main difference is whether the approach to the characteristic maximum size is asymptotic, as in fish and some higher vertebrates, or abrupt as in others, including man.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe a technique to evaluate the evolutionary dynamics of the timing of spawning for iteroparous species. The life cycle of the species consists of three life stages, embryonic, juvenile and adult whereby the transitions of life stages (gametogenesis, birth and maturation) occur at species-specific sizes. The dynamics of the population is studied in a semi-chemostat environment where the inflowing food concentration is periodic (annual). A dynamic energy budget-based continuous-time model is used to describe the uptake of the food, storage in reserves and allocation of the energy to growth, maintenance, development (embryos, juveniles) and reproduction (adults). A discrete-event process is used for modelling reproduction. At a fixed spawning date of the year, the reproduction buffer is emptied and a new cohort is formed by eggs with a fixed size and energy content. The population consists of cohorts: for each year one consisting of individuals with the same age which die after their last reproduction event. The resulting mathematical model is a finite-dimensional set of ordinary differential equations with fixed 1-year periodic boundary conditions yielding a stroboscopic map. We will study the evolutionary development of the population using the adaptive dynamics approach. The trait is the timing of spawning. Pairwise and mutual invasibility plots are calculated using bifurcation analysis of the stroboscopic map. The evolutionary singular strategy value belonging to the evolutionary endpoint for the trait allows for an interpretation of the reproduction strategy of the population. In a case study, parameter values from the literature for the bivalve Macoma balthica are used.},

Empirical support for depensation from population-level data is, however, hard to obtain and inconclusive. Using a size-structured, individual-based model we show that catastrophic population collapses may nonetheless be an intrinsic property of many communities, because of two general aspects of individual life history: size- and food-dependent individual growth and individual mortality decreasing with body size. Positive density dependence, characteristic for depensatory growth mechanisms and catastrophic behavior, results as a direct and robust consequence of the interplay between these individual life-history traits, which are commonly found in many species.},

abstract = {Time-varying selectivity is one of the main challenges in single species age-based assessment models. In classical deterministic VPA-type models the fishing mortality rates are unfiltered representations of the observed catches. As a consequence the selectivity becomes time-varying, but this representation is too fluctuating, because it includes the observation noise. In parametric statistical catch at age models a common assumption is that the selectivity is constant in all years, although time-varying selectivity can be introduced by splitting the data period in blocks with different selectivities, or by using smoothing splines and penalized time-deviances. However, these methods require subjective choices w.r.t. the degree of time-varying allowed. A simple state-space assessment model is presented as an alternative, which among other benefits offers an objective way of estimating time-varying selectivity pattern. The fishing mortality rates are considered (possibly correlated) stochastic processes, and the corresponding process variances are estimated within the model. The model is applied to North Sea cod and it is verified from simulations that time-varying selectivity can be estimated.},

The integral Lotka model is employed to explicitly describe the time-varying age of harvesting. It is proven that in the case of the exponential discounting and infinite horizon the optimal strategy is a stationary solution with a constant harvesting age. A numeric example on optimal forest management illustrates the theoretical findings. Discussion and interpretation of the results are provided.},

The results of simulation studies presented in this study are intended to quantify the effects of age-reading errors on the perception of stock trends and short-term management advice. The study is based on Eastern Baltic cod, in which problems with consistent interpretation of otolith structures result in the catch-at-age data being particularly problematic. The results indicate a clear distinction between the performance of the assessment, and the performance of catch forecasts and advice based on that assessment. The ageing error affected the absolute level of estimates of fishing mortality and spawning stock biomass from stock assessments, although overall trends are similar, and general conclusions about the state of the stock are likely to be broadly correct. Greater problems arose in catch forecasts and advice, for which ageing error led to discrepancies between the required and the effective fishing mortality, and a general tendency for ageing error to lead to advice on Total Allowable Catch that would be too optimistic and, therefore, less effective for stock conservation.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a general modelling approach for coupled length-structured fish populations. The model includes a target set of fish species which are modelled with full length structure from egg to adult, together with a highly simplified size-spectrum representation of the rest of the ecosystem (zooplankton, benthos and other fish). For the structured fish species the food requirements for growth, maintenance and reproduction, together with a length-based prey preferences, are used to calculate predation mortalities on the prey. Model output can be assessed against a wide variety of independent observations. As an example we develop a model for cod (Gadus morhua) and nine of its most important fish predators and prey in the North Sea. The model is confronted with time series of stock biomass, recruitment,andlandings, as well as survey dataonlength distributions,anddiet data.Theresults suggest that herring (Clupea harengus) predation on early life history stages of cod is dynamically important, and that high herring abundance may play a role in the decline of stocks even during periods of declining fishing pressure. We show that the maximum sustainable yield of cod is strongly dependent on herring abundance, and that current levels of cod exploitation may become unsustainable if herring recruitment returns to historical high levels. ©},

abstract = {The theoretical exploration of how diversity influences stability has traditionally been approached by species-centric methods. Here we offer an alternative approach to the diversity–stability problem by examining the stability and dynamics of size and trait distributions of individuals. The analysis is performed by comparing the properties of two size spectrum models. The first model considers all individuals as belonging to the same “average” species, i.e., without a description of diversity. The second model introduces diversity by further considering individuals by a trait, here asymptotic body size. The dynamic properties of the models are described by a stability analysis of equilibrium solutions and by the non-equilibrium dynamics. We find that the introduction of trait diversity expands the set of parameters for which the equilibrium is stable and, if the community is unstable, makes the oscillations smaller, slower, and more regular. The stabilizing mechanism is the variation in growth rate between individuals with the same body size but different trait values.},

abstract = {Whereas the El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) affects weather and climate variability worldwide, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) represents the dominant climate pattern in the North Atlantic region. Both climate systems have been demonstrated to considerably influence ecological processes. Several other large-scale climate patterns also exist. Although less well known outside the field of climatology, these patterns are also likely to be of ecological interest. We provide an overview of these climate patterns within the context of the ecological effects of climate variability. The application of climate indices by definition reduces complex space and time variability into simple measures, 'packages of weather'. The disadvantages of using global climate indices are all related to the fact that another level of problems are added to the ecology-climate interface, namely the link between global climate indices and local climate. We identify issues related to: (i) spatial variation; (ii) seasonality; (iii) non-stationarity; (iv) nonlinearity; and (v) lack of correlation in the relationship between global and local climate. The main advantages of using global climate indices are: (i) biological effects may be related more strongly to global indices than to any single local climate variable; (ii) it helps to avoid problems of model selection; (iii) it opens the possibility for ecologists to make predictions; and (iv) they are typically readily available on Internet.},

abstract = {The complexity and cost of assessment techniques prohibits their application to 90{\%} of fisheries. Simple generic approaches are needed for the world’s small-scale and data-poor fisheries. This meta-analysis of the relationship between spawning potential and the normalized size and age of 123 marine species suggests that the so-called Beverton–Holt life-history invariants (BH-LHI; Lm/L1,M/k,M × Agem) ac- tually vary together in relation to life-history strategy, determining the relationship between size, age, and reproductive potential for each species. Although little realized, the common assumption of unique values for the BH-LHI also implies that all species share the same re- lationship between size, age, and reproductive potential. This implicit assumption is not supported by this meta-analysis, which suggests that there is considerable but predictable natural variation in the BH-LHI ratios and the relationships between size, age, and reproductive potential that they determine.Webelieve that this reconceptualization of the BH-LHI has potential to provide a theoretical framework for “borrowing” knowledge from well-studied species to apply to related, unstudied species and populations, and when applied togetherwith the assessment technique described by Hordyk et al. (this issue b), could make simple forms of size-based assessment possible for many currently unassessable fish stocks.},

However, well-intentioned management plans may not meet this balance as most do not include the effect of climate change. Ocean temperatures are expected to increase through the 21st century, which will have far-reaching and complex impacts on marine fisheries. To begin to quantify these impacts for one coastal fishery along the east coast of the United States, we develop a coupled climate–population model for Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus). The model is based on a mechanistic hypothesis: recruitment is determined by temperature-driven, overwinter mortality of juveniles in their estuarine habitats. Temperature forecasts were obtained from 14 general circulation models simulating three CO2 emission scenarios. An ensemble-based approach was used in which a multimodel average was calculated for a given CO2 emission scenario to forecast the response of the population. The coupled model indicates th...},

We examine the most recent ICES assessment of the North Sea cod stock to see if the present exploitation regimen is sustainable. Our analysis suggests that not only is the present exploitation rate unsustainable, but that even regimens close to the maximum sustainable yield may be potentially prone to risk. There is a need for swift and effective action to protect the stock and avoid the problems of the much publicized collapse of cod stocks off the coast of Atlantic Canada.},

Given a time series of annual catch and effort data, models in the Deriso– Schnute family predict exploitable biomass in the following year from biomass in the current and previous year and from past spawning stock. A state–space model is used, as it allows incorporation of random errors in both the biomass dynamics equations and the observations. Because the biomass dynamics are nonlinear, the common Kalman filter is generally not applicable for parameter estimation. However, it is demonstrated that the Bayesian approach can handle any form of nonlinear relationship in the state and observation equations as well as realistic distributional assumptions. Difficulties with posterior calculations are overcome by the Gibbs sampler in conjunction with the adaptive rejection Metropolis sampling algorithm.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Health recommendations advocating increased fish consumption need to be placed in the context of the potential collapse of global marine capture fisheries. METHODS: Literature overview. RESULTS: In economically developed countries, official healthy eating advice is to eat more fish, particularly that rich in omega-3 oils. In many less economically developed countries, fish is a key human health asset, contributing >20{\%} of animal protein intake for 2.6 billion people. Marine ecologists predict on current trends that fish stocks are set to collapse in 40 years, and propose increased restrictions on fishing, including no-take zones, in order to restore marine ecosystem health. Production of fishmeal for aquaculture and other non-food uses (22 MT in 2003) appears to be unsustainable. Differences in fish consumption probably contribute to within-country and international health inequalities. Such inequalities are likely to increase if fish stocks continue to decline, while increasing demand for fish will accelerate declines in fish stocks and the health of marine ecosystems. CONCLUSIONS: Urgent national and international action is necessary to address the tensions arising from increasing human demand for fish and seafood, and rapidly declining marine ecosystem health.},

We present a simple method of graphical analysis for assessing these parameters, and we develop a related statistical model, based on the modern theory of time series analysis. Our model incorporates a range of possible error structures that include both natural variability (process error) and data uncertainty (measurement error). We illustrate the model's application with data from an exploited lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus) stock. Preliminary graphical estimates sf parameters agree remarkably well with final estimates from the statistical model. Where possible, we investigate alternative viewpoints associated with (1) choices of error structure, (2) dynamic and equilibrium versions of the model, (3) uncertain growth parameters, (4) different abundance indices, (5) mark-recapture experiments, and (6) availability of size-frequency data.},

abstract = {This study challenges the widely held view that improved fisheries selectivity would always help to maintain marine biodiversity. Using a length-based multi-species model, we investigate the effects of selective versus nonselective fishing on fish communities. Both size and species selectivity are examined, and fishing effects on biodiversity are measured with three indices: (i) evenness, (ii) the number of collapsed species, and (iii) an index of size diversity. The model is parameterized for the Georges Bank and North Sea fish communities. The results suggest that there is no “optimal” size selectivity to maintain biodiversity: the effects of each exploitation pattern depend on the selectivity of the gear (i.e., the shape of the selection curve) relative to the available sizes. Catching a narrow range of species almost always reduced evenness and species richness more than taking the same catch from a broader range of species. In summary, neither selective nor nonselective fishing can be said to be generally preferable for conserving biodiversity; the outcome depends on the particular species composition and size structure of the community. Advice intended to inform management will need to be based on clear definitions of biodiversity, and unambiguous management objectives for biodiversity and the fishery.},

abstract = {Ecosystem-based management requires the development of indicators that allow anthropogenic impacts to be detected against the background of natural variation. Size- based community metrics are potentially useful indicators because of their theoretical foundation and practical utility. Temporal and spatial patterns in size-based community metrics for Celtic Sea fish are described and calculated using data from the English groundfish survey of the area (1987e2003). The results reveal that the size structure of the community has changed over time, and that a decrease in the relative abundance of larger fish was accompanied by an increase in smaller fish (4e25 g). Temporal analyses of the effects of fishing and climate variation suggest that fishing generally has had a stronger effect on size structure than changes in temperature. Therefore, size-based metrics respond clearly to the effects of fishing even in variable environments, reflecting the ubiquity of size-based processes in defining community structure and responses to mortality. Spatial analyses were inconclusive, probably owing to the limited area for which fishing effort, temperature, and survey data were all available.},

abstract = {To measure and predict the response of fish communities to exploitation, it is necessary to understand how the direct and indirect effects of fishing interact. Because fishing and pre- dation are size-selective processes, the potential response can be explored with size-based models. We use a simulation approach to describe the relationship between size spectrum slope and overall fishing mortality and to try to understand how a linear spectrum might be maintained. The model uses 15 parameters to describe a 13-‘‘species’’ fish community, where species are defined by their maximum body size and the general relationship between size and life-history characteristics. The simulations allow us to assess the role of changes in the strength and type of density dependence in controlling the response to fishing, and to investigate the trade-off between catches and stock status of the different species. The out- puts showed that the linear slope of the size spectrum was a function of community exploi- tation rate. Density-dependent controls, specifically predation mortality and the extent of compensation in the stock-recruit relationship, were key mechanisms in maintaining a linear spectrum. A linear spectrum emerged independent of the rate of compensation in the stock- recruit relationship. When this rate was low, the effects of changes in fishing mortality on predator abundance dominated those on spawning-stock biomass, whereas the dominance was reversed when the compensation rate in the stock-recruit relationship was high. The approach allows us to explore the effects of different fishing mortality schedules on proper- ties of the fish community, to assess how fishing affects species with different life histories in mixed fisheries, and to assess the effects of selectively fishing different size classes. The simulations indicate that the size classes to be included when developing and interpreting size-based metrics must be carefully considered in relation to the trophic structure and likely strength of predatory interactions in the community. Runs with different fishing mor- tality by size suggest that the dynamics of predation cannot compensate fully for changing rates and patterns of exploitation, implying that the effects of selectively fishing different size classes should be assessed on a case-by-case basis.},

@article{Ottersen2006,
abstract = {Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) is one of the commer- cially most important fish species in the North Atlantic and plays a central role in several ecosystems. Fishing pressure has been heavy over a prolonged period and the recent decades have shown dramatic decline in abundance of many stocks. The Arcto- Norwegian (or North-east Arctic) cod stock in the Barents Sea is now the largest stock of Atlantic cod. Recruitment to this stock has varied extensively dur- ing the last 60 yr. There is evidence for fluctuations in climate, particularly sea temperature, being a main cause for this variability, higher temperatures being favourable for survival throughout the critical early life stages. Our studies of time series present compelling evidence for a strengthening of the climate–cod recruitment link during the last decades. We suggest this is an effect of the age and length composition of the spawning stock having changed distinctly. The age of the average spawner has decreased by more than 3 yr from between 10 and 11 in the late 1940s to 7–8 in the 1990s, average length from just above 90 cm to around 80 cm. The number of age classes contributing to the spawning stock has also decreased, while the number of length groups present increased slightly. Significant decrease in age of spawners has frequently been described for other heavily fished stocks world- wide. We therefore find it likely that the proposed mechanism of increased influence of climate on recruitment through changes in the spawning stock age and size composition is of a general nature and might be found in other systems.},

abstract = {We develop a systematic toolbox for analyzing the adaptive dynamics of multidimensional traits in physiologically structured population models with point equilibria (sensu Dieckmann et al. in Theor. Popul. Biol. 63:309-338, 2003). Firstly, we show how the canonical equation of adaptive dynamics (Dieckmann and Law in J. Math. Biol. 34:579-612, 1996), an approximation for the rate of evolutionary change in characters under directional selection, can be extended so as to apply to general physiologically structured population models with multiple birth states. Secondly, we show that the invasion fitness function (up to and including second order terms, in the distances of the trait vectors to the singularity) for a community of N coexisting types near an evolutionarily singular point has a rational form, which is model-independent in the following sense: the form depends on the strategies of the residents and the invader, and on the second order partial derivatives of the one-resident fitness function at the singular point. This normal form holds for Lotka-Volterra models as well as for physiologically structured population models with multiple birth states, in discrete as well as continuous time and can thus be considered universal for the evolutionary dynamics in the neighbourhood of singular points. Only in the case of one-dimensional trait spaces or when N = 1 can the normal form be reduced to a Taylor polynomial. Lastly we show, in the form of a stylized recipe, how these results can be combined into a systematic approach for the analysis of the (large) class of evolutionary models that satisfy the above restrictions.},

abstract = {Climate effects on the structure and function of marine communities have received scant attention. The few existing approaches for predicting climate effects suggest that community responses might be predicted from the responses of component populations. These approaches require a very complex understanding of ecological interactions among populations. An alternate and informative parallel process is to ask whether it is possible to make predictions about community level responses to climate that are independent of knowledge about the identity and dynamics of component populations. We propose that it is possible to make such predictions, based on knowledge of the processes that determine the size–structure of communities. We suggest that theory that relates metabolic scaling, predator–prey interactions and energy transfer in size-based food webs, allows the size–structure and productivity of communities across a range of trophic levels to be predicted, provided that predictions of the effects of climate on primary production are available. One simple application of the community-focused predictions is to ask whether predictions of the size composition and abundance of populations for alternate climate scenarios are compatible with predictions for the size composition and relative abundance of communities. More sophisticated treatments could predict the effects of climate scenarios on multiple interacting populations and compare their combined size-abundance structure and production with that predicted for the community under the same climate scenario. The main weakness of the community approach is that themethods predict abundance and production by size-class rather than taxonomic group, and society would be particularly concerned if climate driven changes had a strong effect on the relative production of fishable and non-fishable species in the community. The main strength of the community approach is that it provides widely applicable ‘null’ models for assessing the biological effects of climate change and a baseline for model comparisons.},

abstract = {The apparently intense selective differentials imposed by many fisheries may drive the rapid evolution of growth rates. In a widely-cited laboratory experiment, Conover {\&} Munch (2002; Science 297:94–96) found considerable evolutionary change in the size of harvested fish over 4 gen- erations. Their empirical model has since been used to estimate the impact of fishery-driven evolu- tion on fishery sustainability. Using a mathematical, individual-based model (IBM) that simulates that experiment, we showed that the selection imposed in the Conover {\&} Munch (2002) model is unreal- istically strong when compared to harvest rates in wild fisheries. We inferred the evolutionary change that could be expected over the timescale used by Conover {\&} Munch (2002), had they simulated more realistic harvest regimes, and found that the magnitude in their original experiment was 2.5 to 5 times greater. However, over evolutionary timescales of 30 generations and with realistic fishing pressure, the results of Conover {\&} Munch (2002) are comparable to wild fisheries. This simulation result pro- vides support for the use of empirical models to predict the impacts of fishery-driven evolution on yields and sustainability. Future models should consider the timing of fishing events, the trade-off between size, maturation and growth, and density-dependent effects for a comprehensive analysis of the consequences of fishery-driven evolution.},

The derivations are relevant for communities with a size-based trophic structure, i.e. where trophic level is strongly correlated with individual size as in many aquatic systems. The derivations are used to link Lindeman's trophic theory and trophic theory based on average individuals with explicit individual-level size spectrum theory. The trophic efficiency based on the transfer of mass between trophic levels through predator-prey interactions is demonstrated to be valid only when somatic growth can be ignored. Taking somatic growth into account yields an average individual growth efficiency that is smaller than the trophic efficiency.},

abstract = {This paper presents an original size-structured mathematical model of the energy flow through marine ecosystems, based on established ecological and physiological processes and mass conservation principles. The model is based on a nonlocal partial differential equation which represents the transfer of energy in both time and body weight (size) in marine ecosystems. The processes taken into account include size-based opportunistic trophic interactions, competition for food, allocation of energy between growth and reproduction, somatic and maturity maintenance, predatory and starvation mor- tality. All the physiological rates are temperature-dependent. The physiological bases of the model are derived from the dynamic energy budget theory. The model outputs the dynamic size-spectrum of marine ecosystems in term of energy con- tent per weight class as well as many other size-dependent diagnostic variables such as growth rate, egg production or pre- dation mortality. In stable environmental conditions and using a reference set of parameters derived from empirical studies, the model converges toward a stationary linear log–log size-spectrum with a slope equal to 1.06, which is consistent with the values reported in empirical studies. In some cases, the distribution of the largest sizes departs from the stationary linear solution and is slightly curved downward. A sensitivity analysis to the parameters is conducted systematically. It shows that the stationary size-spectrum is not very sensitive to the parameters of the model. Numerical simulations of the effects of temperature and primary production variability on marine ecosystems size-spectra are provided in a companion paper [Maury, O., Shin, Y.-J., Faugeras, B., Ben Ari, T., Marsac, F., 2007.

ICES advisory framework 1977–2012: from Fmax to precautionary approach and beyond. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, doi:10.1093/icesjms/fst146.$\backslash$nThe International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) provides fishery advice in the context of international agreements and addressing the policy and legal needs of ICES Member Countries. This advice is often formulated for an annual total allowable catch based on decisions made by the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) during the first half of the 1970s. Although this early advice was initially focused on the best usage of the growth potential of the fish stocks, the collapse of important pelagic stocks in the late 1960s and the early 1970s suggested that the biological advice should include serious considerations of the spawning–stock biomass (SSB). ICES responded with a new advisory framework in 1976. Over the next 30 years, the advisory framework evolved, with increasing emphasis placed on ensuring SSB to avoid impairing recruitment. The Plan of Implementation of the 2002 UN World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) calls for the restoration and maintenance of fish stocks to levels than can produce the fisheries that provide maximum sustainable yield (MSY). In 2009, ICES revised its advisory framework now formulated as a harvest control rule aimed at achieving MSY.},

abstract = {Matrix population models require the population to be divided into discrete stage classes. In many cases, especially when classes are defined by a continuous variable, such as length or mass, there are no natural breakpoints, and the division is artificial. We introduce the “integral projection model,” which eliminates the need for division into discrete classes, without requiring any additional biological assumptions. Like a traditional matrix model, the integral projection model provides estimates of the asymptotic growth rate, stable size distribution, reproductive values, and sensitivities of the growth rate to changes in vital rates. However, where the matrix model represents the size distributions, reproductive value, and sensitivities as step functions (constant within a stage class), the integral projection model yields smooth curves for each of these as a function of individual size. We describe a method for fitting the model to data, and we apply this method to data on an endangered plant species, northern monkshood (Aconitum noveboracense), with individuals classified by stem diameter. The matrix and integral models yield similar estimates of the asymptotic growth rate, but the reproductive values and sensitivities in the matrix model are sensitive to the choice of stage classes. The integral projection model avoids this problem and yields size-specific sensitivities that are not affected by stage duration. These general properties of the integral projection model will make it advantageous for other populations where there is no natural division of individuals into stage classes.},

An approach is outlined for conducting stock assessments in which parameters are estimated for multiple stocks at the same time. Information from data-rich stock assessments, e.g. trends in fishing mortality, and values for parameters of selectivity functions are provided to data-poor assessments in the form of penalties on the estimated parameters, which leads to stock assessments for the most data-poor stocks being informed by those for the most data-rich stocks. The method is applied for example purposes to data for nine stocks in Australia's southern and eastern scalefish and shark fishery. The results of the application confirm that results for data-rich stocks are little impacted by being assessed in conjunction with data-poor stocks and that the results for data-poor stocks can be qualitatively different when information for data-rich stocks is taken into account.},

We derive the abundance of species as a function of their asymptotic size. The derivation is based on size-spectrum theory, where population structure is derived from physiology and simple arguments regarding the predator-prey interaction. Using a hypothesis of constant satiation, which states that the average degree of satiation is independent of the size of an organism, the number of individuals with a given size is found to be proportional to the weight raised to the power -2.05, independent of the predator/prey size ratio. This is the first time the spectrum exponent has been derived solely on the basis of processes at the individual level. The theory furthermore predicts that the parameters in the von Bertalanffy growth function are related as K proportional, variantL-1infinity.},

abstract = {The plight of the marine fisheries is attracting increasing attention as unsustainably high exploitation levels, exacerbated by more extreme climatic conditions, are driving stocks to the point of collapse. The North Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), a species which until recently formed a major component of the demersal fisheries, has undergone significant declines across its range. The North Sea stock is typical of many, with a spawning stock biomass that has remained below the safe biological limit since 2000 and recruitment levels near the lowest on record. Cod within the North Sea are currently managed as a single stock, and yet mounting empirical evidence supports the existence of a metapopulation of regionally variable, genetically distinct, sub-stocks. Applying the same management strategies to multiple stocks that differ in their resilience to exploitation inevitably results in the overfishing and likely collapse of the weaker components. Indeed, recent studies have identified two North Sea spawning stocks that have undergone disproportionally large collapses with very substantial reductions in egg production. Similarly affected cod stocks in the northwest Atlantic have shown little evidence of recovery, despite fishery closures. The possible implications of ignoring sub-structuring within management units for biocomplexity, local adaptation and ecosystem stability are considered.},

abstract = {Theory predicts that populations of animals with late maturity, low fecundity, large body size and low body growth rates will have low potential rates of population increase at low abundance. If this is true, then these traits may be used to predict the intrinsic rate of increase for species or populations, as well as extinction risks. We used life-history and population data for 63 stocks of commercially exploited fish species from the northeast Atlantic to test relationships between life-history parameters and the rate of population increase at low abundance. We used cross-taxonomic analyses among stocks and among species, and analyses that accounted for phylogenetic relationships. These analyses confirmed that large-bodied, slow-growing stocks and species had significantly lower rates of recruitment and adult production per spawning adult at low abundance. Furthermore, high ages at maturity were significantly correlated with low maximum recruit production. Contrary to expectation, fecundity was significantly negatively related to recruit production, due to its positive relationship with maximum body size. Our results support theoretical predictions, and suggest that a simply measured life-history parameter can provide a useful tool for predicting rates of recovery from low population abundance.},

abstract = {Future CO2-induced climate change scenarios from Global Circulation Models (GCMs) indicate increasing air temperatures, with the greatest warming in the Arctic and Subarctic. Changes to the wind fields and precipitation patterns are also suggested. These will lead to changes in the hydrographic properties of the ocean, as well as the vertical stratification and circulation patterns. Of particular note is the expected increase in ocean temperature. Based upon the observed responses of cod to temperature variability, the expected responses of cod stocks throughout the North Atlantic to the future temperature scenarios are reviewed and discussed here. Stocks in the Celtic and Irish Seas are expected to disappear under predicted temperature changes by the year 2100, while those in the southern North Sea and Georges Bank will decline. Cod will likely spread northwards along the coasts of Greenland and Labrador, occupy larger areas of the Barents Sea, and may even extend onto some of the continental shelves of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, spawning sites will be established further north than currently. It is likely that spring migrations will occur earlier, and fall returns will be later. There is the distinct possibility that, where seasonal sea ice disappears altogether, cod will cease their migration. Individual growth rates for many of the cod stocks will increase, leading to an overall increase in the total production of Atlantic cod in the North Atlantic. These responses of cod to future climate changes are highly uncertain, however, as they will also depend on the changes to climate and oceanographic variables besides temperature, such as plankton production, the prey and predator fields, and industrial fishing.},

abstract = {We developed a matrix projection method to estimate and validate size-dependent instantaneous rates of natural mortality (M) for isochronal fishes, based on their fecundity and growth. Here we show an example of application to the Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) in Korean sea waters. The parameters of the first row of the Leslie matrix, which represent fecundity, were estimated by combining a von Bertalanffy growth equation covering all life stages, a logistic equation of maturity with body size, and a relationship between body size and fecundity, which were derived fromotolith and gonad analyses of cods collected from the East Sea of Korea from 2003 to 2007. For survival rates in the Leslie matrix, we derived a theoretical mortality curve after assuming M as an inverse function of total length (TL) and long-term equilibrium status of stock. The derived constant for size-specific instantaneous mortality (q) was 46.26 yr−1 cm in TL. The estimates of age-specific M ranged from 9.1yr−1 for age 0 cod to 0.49yr−1 for age 8 cod, on average for age 1 to 8yr, 0.82 yr−1 which is greater by a factor of 4 than the estimate derived by Pauly’s equation, 0.2 yr−1. Our estimate of q is sensitive to the embryonic survival rate, which could vary greatly depending on water temperature, but we assumed as a constant of 10{\%}. However, sensitivity analyses showed that, except age 0, derived age-specific M is robust with varying embryonic survival rate from1{\%} to 100{\%}. Moreover, comparisons of the length frequencies derived fromour Leslie matrix with those derived from catch data did not show any significant difference, suggesting that our theoretically derivedMis reliableenoughfor the purpose of stock assessment.Ourapproachof estimating and validating size-dependent M based on fecundity can be applied and extended to other freshwater and marine fish species, improving reliability of stock assessments for fisheries management.},

@techreport{Ices2012,
abstract = {This report provides a new classification of stock assessment methods that has been developed by the Strategic Initiative on Stock Assessment Methods (SISAM). The classification approach is carried out according to the amounts and/or types of data they use and the degree of age-structured population dynamics. This classification will be useful for organizing information about available approaches and subse- quently providing a guide to assist ICES Working Groups and other fish assessment groups around the world in the selection of the most appropriate methods to con- sider for assessment of their stocks. While a number of axes are relevant for model classification, as model features are multi-dimensional, the “age” axis has been cho- sen here as it encapsulates an important differentiation between models as one transi- tion from the simplest to the most complex. The eight core groupings of the classification scheme are catch only, time series, biomass dynamics models (also termed production models), delayed difference models, age-structured production models, VPA based approaches, statistical catch-at-age models and integrated analy- sis models (which can be length or age based). The rationale and broader description for the classification scheme is described in the report. Some of the features used in differentiating these model categories will occur at multiple levels. The degree to which Bayesian statistical procedures are used varies throughout the spectrum of models. Procedures to model process and measurement error also vary among the many assessment model implementations.},

Our model can be thought of as adding biological realism to Neutral Biodiversity Theory by incorporating size variation and growth dynamics, and allowing demographic rates to depend on the sizes of individuals. We find that the species abundance distribution (SAD) is insensitive to the details of the size structure in our model, demonstrating that the SAD is a poor indicator of size-dependent processes. We also derive the species biomass distribution (SBD) and find that the form of the SBD depends on the underlying size structure. This leads to a prescription for testing multiple, intertwined ecological predictions of the model, and provides evidence that alternatives to the traditional SAD are more closely tied to certain ecological processes. Finally, we describe how our framework may be extended to make predictions for more general types of community structure.},

Here, we base our evaluation of the assessments’ performance on the quality of the advice and on the wider issue of how science is used to produce management advice. At the same time, we consider catch-at-age analyses and catch forecasts in the context of the amount of person-time and expertise available at the relevant working group meetings. The results indicate that, generally, the catch forecasts have been positively biased and that the bias has been driven by three main factors: (i) substantial overestimates of terminal stock size since the late 1990s, (ii) overestimates of incoming recruitment, and (iii) overestimates of growth. Information for other North Sea stocks (haddock, plaice, and sole) suggests that bias is a problem generally, not one unique to cod. Our results include a discussion of ways to use science more effectively in supplying management advice.},

The selected indicators are presented, how they are calculated is explained, and the philosophy behind the comparative approach is given. The combination of selected indicators is intended to reflect different dynamics, tracking processes that display differential responses to fishing, and is meant to provide a complementary means of assessing marine ecosystem trends and states. IndiSeas relied on inputs and insights provided by the local experts from participating ecosystems, helping to understand state and trend indicators and to disentangle the effect of other potential ecosystem drivers, such as climate variability. This project showed that the use of simple and available indicators under an ecosystem approach can achieve a real, wide-reaching evaluation of marine ecosystem status caused by fishing. This is impor- tant because the socio-economics of areas where fishing activities develop differs significantly around the globe, and in many countries, insufficient data are available for complex and exhaustive analyses.},

@article{Yamanaka2012,
abstract = {1. The nature of abundance-body size relationships in animal communities, and especially the drivers behind the observed patterns, have been a focus of persistent debate in animal ecology. In a recent review, Allen et al. (2006) categorized five mechanistic explanations behind the commonly observed polymodality in these relationships: energetic constraints; phylogenetic constraints; biogeographical determinants; habitat structure; and community interactions. Progress in understanding of these patterns and the processes underlying them have been hindered by the use of a range of methods that differ in their validity and robustness. 2. Here, we used data on invertebrate body sizes from a variety of sandy beaches in the UK to test the hypothesis that these communities display modality in their abundance-body size relationships. We quantified modality in the relationships using kernel density estimation and smoothed bootstrap resampling and then evaluated the competing explanations for this modality based on the patterns identified in conjunction with measurements of the physical beach environment. 3. We found bimodal distributions in the body size spectrum for benthic invertebrates at nine of 16 sites. There was a consistent trough in the spectrum at around 0·5-1 mm diameter, which reflected the traditional split between meiofauna and macrofauna. Beaches with finer particle sizes and more heterogeneous macrofauna hosted communities with more than two modes. 4. Our results suggest that modality in sandy beach benthic communities is unlikely to be explained by any single hypothesis. There will be an interplay between physical and biological factors, with different explanations accounting for modality at different scales.},

A review of alternative methods is presented and their applicability to species with high values of M discussed. An extreme-value strategy is proposed for introducing considerations of risk and precaution into a management system based on precautionary reference points. We also focus on problems of estimating MSY and other reference points, review alternative estimators and discuss some of the ecological and life history criteria that affect how these estimators should be used: as targets or limits for exploitation, as indicators of conformity under sustainable harvesting conditions, or even for ecocertification of responsible or sustainable fisheries.},

In the field of fisheries research, management regulations have for long demanded population abundance estimates even if data available are sparse, leading the development of a range of fish stock assessment methods designed for data-poor populations. Here, we present methods developed within the context of fisheries research that can be applied to conduct population abundance estimations when facing data-limitations. We begin the review from the less data-demanding approaches and continue with more data-intensive ones. We discuss the advantages and caveats of these approaches the challenges and management implications associated with data-poor stock assessments and we propose the implementation of the Bayesian hierarchical framework as the most promising avenue for future development and improvement of the current practices},

annote = {The whole exercise is a little bizarre. They make a
simple production model to account for the yield
from fisheries. To this they add some questionable
terms (CT {\&}amp; HTC) and fit it to fishbase data. Then
to demonstrate the use of the model on global
fisheries, they apply it to one population for which
they have a climate envelope model for the
distributional change (this is where the climate
change comes in). The result is not surprisingly
that there is no big change in yield. It is
surprising what you can publish as long as you dress
it up with a map with nice colours. 


For the theoretical part it is remarkable that they have to
go through all these calculations to arrive at a
model which could be written out directly by
reference to Lindeman (1942). The reason for the
very low decline of yield with trophic level could
be that the factor gamma, which is the fraction of
production at a trophic level that a given species
utilizes, increases with trophic level. This is
equivalent to saying that diversity decreases
rapidly with trophic level. Is this credible? I do
not know. Their finding that yield is not
proportional to primary productivity, I would not
worry so much about. The exponent they find is close
to one, and given all the uncertainties involved I
would say that the exponent could just as well be
one. 


I find the CT and HTC terms in the statistical
model highly dubious. Why should MSY be proportional
to CT{\^{}}1.9 ? 


All in all: 1) their theoretical model
is basic; 2) their statistical model is dubious due
to the CT term; 3) their claim that the model can be
used for predicting the change in yield due to
climate change is simply wrong, as the model does
not contain anything related to climate change.},

abstract = {Genetic variance in characters under natural
selection in natural populations determines the way
those populations respond to that selection. Whether
populations show temporal and/or spatial constancy
in patterns of genetic variance and covariance is
regularly considered, as this will determine whether
selection responses are constant over space and
time. Much less often considered is whether
characters show differing amounts of genetic
variance over the life-history of individuals. Such
age-specific variation, if present, has important
potential consequences for the force of natural
selection and for understanding the causes of
variation in quantitative characters. Usin data
from a long-term study of the mute swan Cygnus olor,
we report the partitioning of phenotypic variance in
timing of breeding (subject to strong natural
selection) into component parts over 12 different
age classes. We show that the additive genetic
variance and heritability of this trait are strongly
age-dependent, with higher additive genetic variance
present in young and, particularly, old birds, but
little evidence of any genetic variance for birds of
intermediate ages. These results demonstrate that
age can have a very important influence on the
components of variation of characters in natural
populations, and consequently that separate age
classes cannot be assumed to be equivalent, either
with respect to their evolutionary potential or
response. J9 PROC ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI},

abstract = {Interpretation of data used in fisheries assessment and management requires knowledge of population (e.g. growth, natural mortality, and recruitment), fisheries (e.g. selectivity), and sampling processes.Without this knowledge, assumptions need to be made, either implicitly or explicitly based on the methods used. Incorrect assumptions can have a substantial impact on stock assessment results andmanagement advice. Unfortunately, there is a lack of understanding of these processes for most, if not all, stocks and even for processes that have trad- itionally been assumed to be well understood (e.g. growth and selectivity). We use information content of typical fisheries data that is in- formative about absolute abundance to illustrate some of the main issues in fisheries stock assessment. We concentrate on information about absolute abundance from indices of relative abundance combined with catch, and age and length-composition data and how the information depends on knowledge of population, fishing, and sampling processes. We also illustrate two recently developed diagnostic methods that can be used to evaluate the absolute abundance information content of the data. Finally, we discuss some of the reasons for the slowness of progress in fisheries stock assessment. Keywords:},

abstract = {Body size is perhaps the most fundamental property of an organism and is related to many biological traits, including abundance. The relationship between abundance and body size has been extensively studied in an attempt to quantify the form of the relationship and to understand the processes that generate it. However, progress has been impeded by the under appreciated fact that there are four distinct, but interrelated, relationships between size and abundance that are often confused in the literature. Here, we review and distinguish between these four patterns, and discuss the linkages between them. We argue that a synthetic understanding of size-abundance relationships will result from more detailed analyses of individual patterns and from careful consideration of how and why the patterns are related.},

abstract = {Fisheries are often managed to protect small young fish and to harvest big old fish. This can be wasteful, leading to large parts of catches being discarded. A recent suggestion is that it could be better to distribute fishing more widely across species and body sizes, balancing it more closely to the natural productivity of different organisms. Here, we test effects of such fishing against more traditional methods using a model of a single fish species with a dynamic size spectrum together with a fixed spectrum of plankton. This has the feature that productivity is determined by the bookkeeping of biomass in the model, and decreases as fish grow larger. The results show that harvesting smaller fish (which have higher productivity) allows a greater sustainable biomass yield than harvesting larger fish (which have lower productivity); the greater spawning-stock biomass that comes from protecting large fish contributes to this. Balanced exploitation brings fishing mortality more in line with this natural variation in productivity. In addition, the resilience of the ecosystem to perturbations can be improved, and disruption to the size distribution of organisms in the ecosystem reduced. We argue that there are potentially real benefits to be gained by moving towards more balanced exploitation of marine ecosystems, unconventional though this is.},

abstract = {Despite an abundant literature, hake growth and migration remain poorly understood. A recent tagging campaign and an analysis of the growth increments on juvenile hake otoliths demonstrate that the growth rate has probably been largely underestimated. Migration rates have been studied through qualitative analysis of catch rate, but have not been confirmed by a more-quantitative analysis. Those biological uncertainties affect stock assessments and predictions by the uncertainty they bring to age-length keys and by hindering our ability to assess the impact of spatial management measures. Here, a spatially explicit length-structured model is developed to improve the biological knowledge of European hake (Merluccius merluccius), in terms specifically of migration and growth. The model belongs to the state-space class of models and is fitted by maximum likelihood on commercial landings, survey abundance indices, and tagging data. The estimated growth curve is close to estimates from tagging data, lending weight to the assumption of the species being fast-growing. Few migrations are long in distance, and there are none between the Bay of Biscay and the Celtic Sea. The model also demonstrates a high level of heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of spawning-stock biomass, with concentrations on the margins of the continental shelf.},

@article{Blanchard2009,
abstract = {1. Widely observed macro-ecological patterns in log abundance vs. log body mass of organisms can be explained by simple scaling theory based on food (energy) availability across a spectrum of body sizes. The theory predicts that when food availability falls with body size (as in most aquatic food webs where larger predators eat smaller prey), the scaling between log N vs. log m is steeper than when organisms of different sizes compete for a shared unstructured resource (e.g. autotrophs, herbivores and detritivores; hereafter dubbed 'detritivores'). 2. In real communities, the mix of feeding characteristics gives rise to complex food webs. Such complexities make empirical tests of scaling predictions prone to error if: (i) the data are not disaggregated in accordance with the assumptions of the theory being tested, or (ii) the theory does not account for all of the trophic interactions within and across the communities sampled. 3. We disaggregated whole community data collected in the North Sea into predator and detritivore components and report slopes of log abundance vs. log body mass relationships. Observed slopes for fish and epifaunal predator communities (-1.2 to -2.25) were significantly steeper than those for infaunal detritivore communities (-0.56 to -0.87). 4. We present a model describing the dynamics of coupled size spectra, to explain how coupling of predator and detritivore communities affects the scaling of log N vs. log m. The model captures the trophic interactions and recycling of material that occur in many aquatic ecosystems. 5. Our simulations demonstrate that the biological processes underlying growth and mortality in the two distinct size spectra lead to patterns consistent with data. Slopes of log N vs. log m were steeper and growth rates faster for predators compared to detritivores. Size spectra were truncated when primary production was too low for predators and when detritivores experienced predation pressure. 6. The approach also allows us to assess the effects of external sources of mortality (e.g. harvesting). Removal of large predators resulted in steeper predator spectra and increases in their prey (small fish and detritivores). The model predictions are remarkably consistent with observed patterns of exploited ecosystems.},

abstract = {In aquatic ecosystems, where organisms typically feed and grow by eating smaller individuals, a characteristic size spectrum emerges, such that large organisms are much more rare than small ones. Here, a stochastic individual-based model for the dynamics of size spectra is described, based on birth, growth, and death of individuals, using simple assumptions about feeding behavior. It is shown that the deterministic limit derived from the stochastic process is a partial differential equation previously used to describe the dynamics of size spectra. The equation has two classes of dynamics in the long term. The first is a steady state. A derivation under simple mass-balance assumptions shows that, at steady state, the linear size spectrum relating log abundance to log mass has a slope of approximately -1, similar to that often observed in natural size spectra. The second class of dynamics, not previously described, is a traveling-wave solution in which waves move along the size spectrum from small to large body size. Traveling waves become more likely when predators prefer prey much smaller than themselves and when they are specialized in the range of prey body sizes consumed. Wavelength depends on the size of prey relative to the size of predator, and wave speed depends on how fast mass moves through the spectrum.},

abstract = {Recent reports suggest that many well-assessed fisheries in developed countries are moving toward sustainability. We examined whether the same conclusion holds for fisheries lacking formal assessment, which comprise >80{\%} of global catch. We developed a method using species' life-history, catch, and fishery development data to estimate the status of thousands of unassessed fisheries worldwide. We found that small unassessed fisheries are in substantially worse condition than assessed fisheries, but that large unassessed fisheries may be performing nearly as well as their assessed counterparts. Both small and large stocks, however, continue to decline; 64{\%} of unassessed stocks could provide increased sustainable harvest if rebuilt. Our results suggest that global fishery recovery would simultaneously create increases in abundance (56{\%}) and fishery yields (8 to 40{\%}).},

abstract = {This paper develops a bioeconomic approach to yield-mortality models. The usefulness of the conceptual background of these models, and the application of the resulting reference points (RPs), are analysed in a precautionary management framework. Quantification of uncertainty by bootstrapping provided a more realistic comparison of the relative performance of RPs for management advice. Sensitivity analysis, performed under wide initial variations in the natural mortality coefficient M, displayed two important features of this bioeconomic model: (1) the yield at maximum economic yield (Y(MEY)) and the associated mortality levels Z(MEY) and F(MEY) were always the most conservative RPs. This takes utmost importance at low M values, where maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and the yield at maximum biological production (Y(MBP)) tended to coincide, whereas MEY and mortality-related RPs were substantially lower, thus constituting useful target RPs for precautionary management, (2) The RPs derived from the biological production curve were always lower than those derived from the sustainable yield curve. The former could be used as target RPs, whereas both MSY and F(MSY) should be considered as upper exploitation limits. Sensitivity analysis conducted with the economic input of the system, the unit cost of effort (c), revealed consistency of the bioeconomic performance of the model with accepted theory, i.e., Y(MEY) approaches MSY with decreasing c values. A simple approach to the formulation of risk-averse management strategies was explored using decision theory. For this purpose, the maximax, maximin and minimax regret criterion were used to evaluate alternative management decisions under uncertainty, without the need for explicit statements of probabilities on alternative hypotheses. Results confirmed the need to consider economic and MBP related RPs for precautionary management. Guidelines for future work are suggested.},

abstract = {The majority of global fish stocks lack adequate data to evaluate stock status using conventional stock assessment methods. This poses a challenge for the sustainable management of these stocks. Recent requirements to set scientifically based catch limits in several countries, and growing consumer demand for sustainably managed fish have spurred an emerging field of methods for estimating overfishing thresholds and setting catch limits for stocks with limited data. Using a management strategy evaluation framework we quantified the performance of a number of data-limited methods. For most life-histories, we found that methods that made use of only historical catches often performed worse than maintaining current fishing levels. Only those methods that dynamically accounted for changes in abundance and/or depletion performed well at low stock sizes. Stock assessments that make use of historical catch and effort data did not necessarily out-perform simpler data-limited methods that made use of fewer data. There is a high value of additional information regarding stock depletion, historical fishing effort and current abundance when only catch data are available. We discuss the implications of our results for other data-limited methods and identify future research priorities. © 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {We synthesise traditional unstructured food webs, allometric body size scaling, trait-based modelling, and physiologically structured modelling to provide a novel and ecologically relevant tool for size-structured food webs. The framework allows food web models to include ontogenetic growth and life-history omnivory at the individual level by resolving the population structure of each species as a size-spectrum. Each species is characterised by the trait 'size at maturation', and all model parameters are made species independent through scaling with individual body size and size at maturation. Parameter values are determined from cross-species analysis of fish communities as life-history omnivory is widespread in aquatic systems, but may be reparameterised for other systems. An ensemble of food webs is generated and the resulting communities are analysed at four levels of organisation: community level, species level, trait level, and individual level. The model may be solved analytically by assuming that the community spectrum follows a power law. The analytical solution provides a baseline expectation of the results of complex food web simulations, and agrees well with the predictions of the full model on biomass distribution as a function of individual size, biomass distribution as a function of size at maturation, and relation between predator-prey mass ratio of preferred and eaten food. The full model additionally predicts the diversity distribution as a function of size at maturation.},

abstract = {To examine overfishing and climate effects on depleted cod (Gadus morhua) stocks, a surplus production model based on reconstructions of cod catch in Newfoundland was used to describe biomass dynamics from 1505 to 2004. Productivity parameters r (population growth rate) and K (carrying capacity) were assigned by fitting model to survey biomass. Assumptions of fishery-only influences inferring constant, random, or depensatory parameters fared poorly (did not mimic history), as did climate influences indexed by tree ring growth. However, a model using both climate and depensation fared well, mimicking much documented history of Newfoundland cod, including declines during the Little Ice Age (mid- to late 19th century) and the stock collapses of the late 20th century, with a good fit to recent scientific surveys (r2 = 0.80). This model suggests temporal differentiation between fishing and climate effects, including (i) declines during the Little Ice Age (1800–1880) caused by lower productivity, (ii) collapses in the 1960s caused by overfishing, (iii) collapses in the late 1980s caused by both, and (iv) rebuilding now hindered by depensatory effects of low numbers.},

@article{Conover1995,
abstract = {Cod Gadus morhua stocks on the Labrador Shelf and Grand Banks, NW Atlantic, are apparently at an all-time low. While overfishing has undoubtedly occurred, it is probable that other factors are affecting stock recruitment as well. Water temperatures and salinity are also unusually low, which may have affected the abundance of cod in some way. Northern cod begin spawning in March in most stock management zones around Newfoundland, Canada. First-feeding cod larvae survive in waters less than 2 degrees C but require suitable prey, especially nauplii of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus, to grow well. The 'match/mismatch' hypothesis assumes that cod spawn at the same time each year, but spawning by copepods may or may not 'match' depending on the stimulus provided by the 'spring bloom' of phytoplankton, which can vary with environmental conditions by up to 6 wk. While C. finmarchicus is common in the Atlantic waters of the Labrador Sea and Grand Banks, zooplankton in the Labrador Current, especially during this period of low temperature and salinity, are dominated by 2 arctic copepods, C, glacialis and C, hyperboreus, which have different spawning seasons, and therefore probably would not provide a good nutritional match for young cod. Despite global warming, sea water supporting important demersal fish on the continental shelf off northeast Canada is presently colder and fresher than normal. Global warming may have induced melting of glaciers and sea ice and increased runoff in rivers entering the Arctic Ocean and its coastal drainage, reducing salinity at the sea surface, increasing stability and reducing deep convection, and hence upward heat transport. Several cold, fresh 'anomalies' have been observed in the last few decades and they have contributed to less favourable conditions at locations around the North Atlantic. These anomalies may be part of an interdecadal climate cycle of alternating warm and cold periods, the effects of which must be removed to clearly identify those associated with global warming. Whatever the causes, periods of 'ocean cooling', with potentially serious consequences for the cod fishery, may be predictable. Increasing amounts of ice in the eastern Arctic and Greenland Sea are easily monitored by satellite and appear to anticipate reduced temperature/salinity anomalies in the Labrador Sea by about 4 yr. Climatic impacts, whether cyclic or continuing, could be identified sufficiently far in advance to enable modifications in management of the fishery toward at least mollifying their effects, thus improving the prospects for long-term sustainability.},

abstract = {The quality and quantity of data affect the reliability of all stock assessments. Over time, we expect data to improve and assessment predictions to become more reliable. There is a potential for strong bias in estimates of sustainable yield if the available data are not a good representation of stock dynamics, particularly for catch-based data-poor methods that rely on limited information and assumptions about stock status. We retrospectively investigated the interaction of data quantity and quality through time using the “real-world” data for a stock as it progressed from data-poor to data-rich. For this analysis, we chose a currently data-rich and overfished stock with historical assessments representing both a data-poor and data-moderate state, the canary rockfish (Sebastes pinniger). We asked how changes in the catch history and biological parameters over time affected the estimates of sustainable yield and the overfishing limit (OFL) predicted by two data-poor assessment tools, depletion-corrected average catch (DCAC) and depletion-based stock reduction analysis (DB-SRA). We found that both of these methods underestimated the “true” OFL in simulations with catch error alone. While there was slightly less bias for DB-SRA than DCAC, increasing error in the catch led to a more rapid increase in the variance of the DB-SRA harvest limit (HL). Our retrospective analysis showed that the expectation for a more accurate HL estimate between the data-poor and data-moderate canary rockfish assessments does not come from an increase in the quantity or quality of the catch data alone; a decrease in the quality of the biological data between assessments had the greatest impact. By evaluating these methods with historical data, our retrospective approach highlighted the impact of change in data quality and quantity on HL estimates for a long-lived rockfish, and could be used to define the amount and type of error included in simulation studies that further evaluate data-poor methods.},

abstract = {The dynamics of a population depend upon the sizes and/or maturity of the individual members of the population. In many sepcies (the most popular examples are fish and trees) the growth and maturation rate of an individual is controlled by the ability of that individual to abtain necessary resources. For such a species, individual growth rates depend upon the overall condition of the population. The purpose of this paper is to develop a continous model with size structure, in which individual growth rates are not known a priori. An individual's size depends not only upon it's age, but upon his history of the general population during its past life. The resulting model is a nonlinear variation of the classical McKendrick-von Foerster model. The mathamtical descriptions of growth processes which originate in the biological literature can be used as constitutive equations in our model. In some cases, such substitutions allow the model to be reduced to a system of ordinary differential equations.},

In this model, predation is determined by predator and prey size and abundance, and drives predator growth and prey mortality. Fishing amplifies temporal oscillations in the biomass flow. Oscillations appear at lower fishing intensity and have wider amplitude when fishing is selective (removes a narrow size range) and/or when large fish are targeted, than when fishing is more balanced (catching a larger size range) or when small fish are targeted. A novel index of size diversity is developed, and is shown to be sensitive to both fishing intensity and selectivity. To avoid unstable food web dynamics with potential harmful consequences for fisheries, limiting both fishing intensity and selectivity might be an appropriate exploitation strategy.},

abstract = {We analyse how intensive exploitation may have
caused evolutionary changes in the age and length at
maturation in North Sea plaice Pleuronectes
platessa. Such evolutionary change in the onset of
maturation is expected, given that fishing mortality
is more than 4 times higher than natural
mortality. In order to disentangle phenotypic
plasticity from evolutionary change, we employ the
probabilistic reaction-norm approach. This technique
allows us to estimate the probabilities of maturing
at each relevant age and size, and to disentangle
the plasticity in age and size at maturation that
results from changes in growth rates from
evolutionary changes in maturation propensities
themselves. This recently developed method is
applied here to females of 41 cohorts (1955 to 1995)
of North Sea plaice. We focus on trends in fishing
mortality, in growth rates, and in the probabilities
of maturing, and test the hypothesis that the
decrease in age and length at maturation is partly
caused by fisheries-induced adaptive change. We find
that the reaction norm for age and length at
maturation has indeed significantly shifted towards
younger age and smaller length. The reaction-norm
analysis suggests a picture in which short-term
fluctuations originating from plastic responses are
superimposed on a persistent long-term trend
resulting from genetic responses and higher body
growth.},

abstract = {We derive a fully stochastic model for the dynamics of age and size in a population. The key to our derivation is that the assumptions made about stochastic growth and survival, in conjunction with some approximations made in the analysis of size-selective fishing mortality, allow us to propagate through time the probability density function of size of individuals in the population by a recursive update of its parameters. The model permits a concise description of the size distribution at age based on mean log-length and variance. The stochastic process is characterized in the model in just a few parameters: two growth coefficients, one variance parameter associated with growth, instantaneous risk of natural mortality, instantaneous risk of fishing mortality, which is a separable function of size-specific selectivity and annual full recuitment fishing mortality, and initial conditions (year-class strength, initial size distribution). Estimation theory is developed for the model, and likelihood equations are derived which provide statistical principles for setting the trade-off between fitting data on length frequency, on total bioriass of catch, and sn age frequency. the tractability of the model permits a clear description of saer{\~{}}pling probability distributions. A number of simpler models, such as catch-age models and delay-difference models, fit within the theoretical framework sf our stochastic model.},

@article{Mueter2006,
abstract = {We used time series of biomass and catches for the major commercial groundfish stocks in the Eastern Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands region and in the Gulf of Alaska to compute annual surplus production for 1977–2004. Annual surplus production and average annual biomass were aggregated across stocks within each region to examine the relationship between total surplus production and total aggregated biomass. We fit two surplus production models (Graham-Schaefer and Pella-Tomlinson) to the observed relationships to estimate maximum multi-species surplus production (equivalent to maximum sustainable yield) of the groundfish complexes in these ecosystems. Maximum multi-species surplus production was estimated to be approximately 2.5×106 t in the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands and 330×103 t in the Gulf of Alaska. These point estimates were smaller than the sum of single-species MSY proxies from recent stock assessments, and estimates for the Gulf of Alaska were much smaller than earlier estimates that were used to specify optimum yield ranges for the Gulf of Alaska groundfish complex. Therefore, optimum yield ranges for the Gulf of Alaska may need to be re-assessed to reflect more recent conditions. We further estimated the effects of environmental variability on annual surplus production using correlations and generalized surplus production models with environmental covariates. Results suggest that surplus production in the Bering Sea may be lower during conditions associated with the positive phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which is characterized by warmer temperatures, reduced ice, and reduced wind mixing over the shelf. Similarly, surplus production on the Gulf of Alaska shelf was lower during years with warm bottom temperatures coupled with low salinities in late winter. If maximum multi-species surplus production varies as a result of environmental variability, optimum yield ranges for the groundfish complexes in these ecosystems should take such fluctuations into account.},

abstract = {Typical optimal design methods for inverse or parameter estimation problems are designed to choose optimal sampling distributions through minimization of a specific cost function related to the resulting error in parameter estimates. It is hoped that the inverse problem will produce parameter estimates with increased accuracy using data collected according to the optimal sampling distribution. Here we formulate the classical optimal design problem in the context of general optimization problems over distributions of sampling times. We present a new Prohorov metric based theoretical framework that permits one to treat succinctly and rigorously any optimal design criteria based on the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). A fundamental approximation theory is also included in this framework. A new optimal design, SE-optimal design (standard error optimal design), is then introduced in the context of this framework. We compare this new design criteria with the more traditional D-optimal and E-optimal designs. The optimal sampling distributions from each design are used to compute and compare standard errors; the standard errors for parameters are computed using asymptotic theory or bootstrapping and the optimal mesh. We use three examples to illustrate ideas: the Verhulst-Pearl logistic population model [13], the standard harmonic oscillator model [13] and a popular glucose regulation model [16, 19, 29].},

abstract = {Recent observations suggest fishing pressure is driving the evolution of smaller female maturation size in some fish stocks. We construct a general size-based theoretical framework to derive the rate and ultimate destination of this evolution based on life-history, community ecology and evolutionary theory. For Baltic cod (Gadus morhua), we find a maximum evolutionary rate of approximately −36 g/generation (−0.072 Haldanes) and optimum maturation size <250 g (mean≈50 g). Whilst this is consistent with many previous observations, it is substantially less than observed in rapidly declining cod stocks, suggesting additional evolutionary processes may affect them. Analysis of management remedies finds only an effective ban on fishing will halt the evolution. Unable to maximise fitness, the fish will remain under evolutionary stress for the foreseeable future.},

abstract = {The eastern Bering Sea (EBS) is a highly productive subarctic marine ecosystem that is exposed to considerable climate variability and is noted for conservative management of its fishery resources. The community size spectrum (CSS; relationship between animal abundance and size) of fish captured in EBS shelf bottom trawl surveys was examined for evidence of change over time and fishing and climate effects. The slope (indicative of fish size) and height (indicative of ecosystem productivity, or essentially fish abundance) of the CSS can change due to changes in fishing intensity and climate variability. Linear trends were not observed in EBS groundfish size or abundance during 1982–2006. The abundance of large-sized fish increased in 2001–2006 relative to 1982–2000. Observed changes in CSS height partially corroborated evidence for decreased productivity of the main fishery target species since the late 1990s, which may have been due to changes in relative species composition. In addition, abundance and size composition of nontarget fish decreased during 1982–2006, possibly related to changes in water temperature. In contrast, however, the size and productivity of fish that were primarily bycatch species increased during 1982–2006. Unlike in other ecosystems, changes in CSS slopes and heights for the EBS were not related to exploitation rates. Changes in the abundance of fish in areas that were normally occupied by cold bottom water (northwest inner and middle shelf) may have been related to the effects of temperature on fish distribution.},

abstract = {Robustness of both short-term stock biomass recovery and longer-term sustainable management strategies to different plausible climatic change scenarios were evaluated for North Sea cod (Gadus morhua), where climate was assumed to impact growth and recruitment. In the short term, climate change had little effect on stock recovery, which depends instead upon reducing fishing effort to allow existing year classes to survive to maturity. In the longer term, climate change has greater effects on stock status, but higher yields and biomass can be expected if fishing mortality is reduced. Incorporating environmental covariates in stock assessment predictions will not achieve sustainable resource use. The implications of climate change for biological reference points depend upon the mechanism through which temperature acts on recruitment, i.e. on juvenile survival or carrying capacity. It is not possible to distinguish between these processes with stock assessment data sets alone. However, this study indicates that reference points based on fishing mortality appear more robust to uncertainty than those based on biomass. Ideally, simpler management procedures are required that meet pre-agreed management objectives and are robust to uncertainty about the true dynamics.},

abstract = {Climate may affect marine fish populations through many different pathways, operating at a variety of temporal and spatial scales. Climate impacts may work their way bottom up through the food web or affect higher trophic levels more directly. In this review we try to disentangle and summarize some of the current knowledge made available through the rapidly increasing literature on the topic, with particular emphasis on the work within the Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics (GLOBEC) programme. We first consider different classification schemes and hypotheses relating climate through physical features of the ocean to population patterns. The response of a population or community to climate may be linear or non-linear, direct or indirect. The hypotheses may be classified according to the form of physical features in operation as being related to mixing, advection or temperature. The bulk of the paper is devoted to a region-by-region presentation and discussion of examples relating climate variability to marine fish populations. It is slanted towards the North Atlantic and North Pacific, but the tropical Pacific is also covered. By means of different categorization methods we compare climate responses between ecosystems. We conclude that the use of such classification schemes allows for a more precise description of the various ecosystems particular properties and facilitates inter-regional comparison.},

abstract = {Body size and temperature are the two most important variables affecting nearly all biological rates and times, especially individual growth or production rates. By favoring an optimal maturation age and reproductive allocation, natural selection links individual growth to the mortality schedule. A recent model for evolution of life histories for species with indeterminate growth, which includes most fish, successfully predicts the numeric values of two key dimensionless numbers and the allometry of the average reproductive allocation versus maturation size across species. Here we use this new model to predict the relationships of age-at-maturity, adult mortality and reproductive effort to environmental temperature and maturation size across species. Age-at-maturity, adult mortality and the proportion of the body mass given to reproduction per year are predicted to show ±0.25 power allometries with mass at maturity, and an exponential (Boltzmann) temperature dependence. Temperature is assumed to affect only body size growth, so the temperature linkages of maturation, mortality and reproductive effort are indirect via life history optimization; this is briefly contrasted with the idea that (for example) temperature directly affects mortality.},

@article{Ludovisi2012,
abstract = {Although several exergy-based indicators of ecosystem state have been put forward during the last decades, their effectiveness still expect a full confirmation. Recently, Ludovisi has proposed a formu- lation of exergy based on classical thermodynamics, which includes three terms – size (C), concentration (X) and structural information (I) – accounting for the contribution to exergy due to the abiotic and biotic components of an ecosystem, with the latter being expressed as a function of (sub)community struc- ture and diversity. In the present study, the response of the different exergy terms is analysed along the seasonal progression of environmental conditions and phytoplankton in the Lagoon of Lesina (Puglia, Italy). According to the proposed methodology, the equilibrium concentration of the main hydrochemical variables has been calculated on the basis of a suitable hydrochemical model. The estimate of the equilib- rium concentration of the phytoplankton (the VECE values) has been performed for logarithmic body-size classes by applying the equilibrium condition to the complete oxidation of the biomass. The results show that: (i) hydrochemical and phytoplankton exergy, as well as exergy terms (size C, concentration X and structural information I) are positively correlated one another, thus suggesting that phytoplankton con- tributed to enhance the total exergy of the water column of the lagoon also affecting the hydrochemistry of the system, especially during massive blooms; (ii) exergy and structural information of phytoplankton increase with increasing phytoplankton biomass, thus indicating that the size spectrum of phytoplankton diverges from the equilibrium distribution as the biomass stored increases (or vice versa); (iii) the size- fractioned Shannon information of phytoplankton increases with increasing biomass density as well as structural information, before reaching a superior limit. On the whole, the observed trends are consistent with theoretical expectations based on thermodynamics and classical ecological theories of succession, thus confirming the effectiveness of exergy-based tools as indicators of ecosystem development, as well as ecological orientors. ©},

@article{Cochrane2000,
abstract = {Concern about the global state of fisheries and fish resources has highlighted the three primary considerations in fisheries management: sustainable utilisation, economic efficiency and equity in access to resources. We appear to be failing in pursuit of all three goals. Living marine resources are particularly threatened by overfishing, leading to many of the world’s fish stocks being heavily, fully or over exploited. Similarly, the economic diagnosis is that costs of fishing exceeded the value of the world’s catch by about US{\$} 40 billion at the beginning of the decade. Statistics on equity are less available, but the necessary spread of limited access to fisheries frequently has the greatest impact on the small scale, traditional fisher. This paper considers the reasons underlying the general failure of fisheries management and the solutions that are being proposed. Factors contributing to the problems include high biological uncertainty, conflict between the constraint of sustainability and social and economic priorities, poorly defined objectives, and institutional failures related to access rights and participation in management by the users. These issues point to the real complexity of fisheries management. It is argued that this complexity can be abused by all interest groups to avoid responsibility and to suit their own objectives. It is suggested that there are eight simple principles controlling fisheries management that are generally well-understood and, if properly considered in fisheries management systems, would lead to improved performances. Responsible management will, however, only be effective if there is a genuine desire to achieve the objectives. Fishing capacity, frequently reflecting dependency of users on fisheries resources, is commonly in excess of the sustainable production of the resources. Excess dependency can preclude the political will to consider alternative strategies and only once it has been overcome, probably requiring solutions borrowed from outside fisheries, is effective management likely to be considered seriously. Thereafter, responsible management requires setting unambiguous objectives and management measures in co-operation with users and other interest groups. The agreed strategy must be included in legislation to ensure transparency and accountability and to constrain decision-makers. The performance of the strategy must be monitored and revised as necessary.},

abstract = {The largest perturbation on upper trophic levels of many marine ecosystems stems from fishing. The reaction of the ecosystem goes beyond the trophic levels directly targeted by the fishery. This reaction has been described either as a change in slope of the overall size spectrum or as a trophic cascade triggered by the removal of top predators. Here we use a novel size- and trait-based model to explore how marine ecosystems might react to perturbations from different types of fishing pressure. The model explicitly resolves the whole life history of fish, from larvae to adults. The results show that fishing does not change the overall slope of the size spectrum, but depletes the largest individuals and induces trophic cascades. A trophic cascade can propagate both up and down in trophic levels driven by a combination of changes in predation mortality and food limitation. The cascade is damped as it comes further away from the perturbed trophic level. Fishing on several trophic levels leads to a disappearance of the signature of the trophic cascade. Differences in fishing patterns among ecosystems might influence whether a trophic cascade is observed.},

abstract = {In preparation for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) modeling centers from around the world carried out sets of global climate simulations under various emission scenarios with a total of 23 coupled atmosphere–ocean general circulation models. We evaluated the models' 20th century hindcasts of selected variables relevant to several large marine ecosystems and examined 21st century projections by a subset of these models under the A1B (middle range) emission scenario. In general we find that a subset (about half) of the models are able to simulate large-scale aspects of the historical observations reasonably well, which provides some confidence in their application for projections of ocean conditions into the future. Over the North Pacific by the mid-21st century, the warming due to the trend in wintertime sea surface temperature (SST) will be 1°–1.5 °C, which is as large as the amplitude of the major mode of variability, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). For areas northwest of the Hawaiian Islands, these models projected a steady increase of 1.2 °C in summer SST over the period from 2000 to 2050. For the Bering and Barents seas, a subset of models selected on the basis of their ability to simulate sea–ice area in late 20th century yield an average decrease in sea–ice coverage of 43{\%} and 36{\%}, respectively, by the decade centered on 2050 with a reasonable degree of consistency. On the other hand, model simulations of coastal upwelling for the California, Canary and Humboldt Currents, and of bottom temperatures in the Barents Sea, feature a relatively large degree of uncertainty. These results illustrate that 21st century projections for marine ecosystems in certain regions using present-generation climate models require additional analysis. ©},

Laboratory data available for marine fish and invertebrates from various climatic regions led to the hypothesis that, as a unifying principle, a mismatch between the demand for oxygen and the capacity of oxygen supply to tissues is the first mechanism to restrict whole-animal tolerance to thermal extremes. We show in the eelpout, Zoarces viviparus, a bioindicator fish species for environmental monitoring from North and Baltic Seas (Helcom), that thermally limited oxygen delivery closely matches environmental temperatures beyond which growth performance and abundance decrease. Decrements in aerobic performance in warming seas will thus be the first process to cause extinction or relocation to cooler waters.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the stability of the power-law steady state often observed in marine ecosystems. Three dynamical systems are considered, describing the abundance of organisms as a function of body mass and time: a "jump-growth" equation, a first order approximation which is the widely used McKendrick-von Foerster equation, and a second order approximation which is the McKendrick-von Foerster equation with a diffusion term. All of these yield a power-law steady state. We derive, for the first time, the eigenvalue spectrum for the linearised evolution operator, under certain constraints on the parameters. This provides new knowledge of the stability properties of the power-law steady state. It is shown analytically that the steady state of the McKendrick-von Foerster equation without the diffusion term is always unstable. Furthermore, numerical plots show that eigenvalue spectra of the McKendrick-von Foerster equation with diffusion give a good approximation to those of the jump-growth equation. The steady state is more likely to be stable with a low preferred predator:prey mass ratio, a large diet breadth and a high feeding efficiency. The effects of demographic stochasticity are also investigated and it is concluded that these are likely to be small in real systems.},

Using projections of future North Sea surface temperatures for the period 2000–2050 from the Hadley General Circulation Model, we estimate the likely effects of climate change on the North Sea cod population. Output from the model suggests that increasing temperatures will lead to an increased rate of decline in the North Sea cod population compared with simulations that ignore environmental change. Although the simulation developed here is relatively simplistic, we demonstrate that inclusion of environmental factors in population models can markedly alter one’s perception of how the population will behave. The development of simulations incorporating environment effects will become increasingly important as the impacts of climate change on the marine ecosystem become more pronounced.},

abstract = {One of the most challenging issues in fisheries management is the evaluation of the effects of fishing in the context of a changing environment. Using the pronghorn spiny lobster (Panulirus penicillatus) fishery off the eastern coast of Taiwan as an example, we developed an individual-based model (IBM) that is capable of describing the temperature-de- pendent life history processes and fishery practices for the spiny lobster. We then used the model to evaluate potential im- pacts of increased ocean temperature on the estimation of mortality-based biological reference points for fisheries management. We demonstrate that a warming temperature would increase the yield-per-recruit and eggs-per-recruit values and consequently reduce the risk of overexploitation under the current exploitation level. However, there is likely a high risk of overexploitation in the long term if higher temperatures induce extra-high natural mortality. The evaluation of ef- fectiveness of size regulations suggests that increasing minimum legal size is proposed as a good candidate measure to re- duce the risk of overexploitation for pessimistically unfavorable environmental conditions. This study suggests that an explicit incorporation of the relationships between environmental variables and biological processes can greatly improve fisheries assessment and management.},

abstract = {Understanding how ecological communities are structured and how this may vary between different types of ecosystems is a fundamental question in ecology. We develop a general framework for quantifying size-structure within and among different ecosystem types (e.g. terrestrial, freshwater or marine), via the use of a suite of bivariate relationships between organismal size and properties of individuals, populations, assemblages, pair-wise interactions, and network topology. Each of these relationships can be considered a dimension of size-structure, along which real communities lie on a continuous scale. For example, the strength, slope, or elevation of the body mass-versus-abundance or predator size-versus-prey size relationships may vary systematically among ecosystem types. We draw on examples from the literature and suggest new ways to use allometries for comparing among ecosystem types, which we illustrate by applying them to published data. Finally, we discuss how dimensions of size-structure are interconnected and how we could approach this complex hierarchy systematically. We conclude: (1) there are multiple dimensions of size-structure; (2) communities may be size-structured in some of these dimensions, but not necessarily in others; (3) across-system comparisons via rigorous quantitative statistical methods are possible, and (4) insuffi cient data are currently available to illuminate thoroughly the full extent and nature of diff erences in size-structure among ecosystem types.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the consistency of three methods for assigning annuli in adult Baltic cod otoliths. The methods examined were (i) daily increment patterns, (ii) opacity profiles, and (iii) traditional age reading. Frequency distributions of the dis- tance from the nucleus to the different zones showed that the first annulus of traditional age reading missed the first zone of both increment and opacity methods, but overlapped with the second zone identified by these methods. This pattern did not continue over subsequent zones. Frequency distributions of increment patterns were similar to opacity patterns. However, within individual fish, the co-occurrence of overlap between the two patterns was random. In cases where there was overlap, translucent zone formation started just before the disappearance of visible increments. Overlap in 1 year did not necessarily lead to a consistent pattern the fol- lowing year, and overlap was not influenced by sex or fish size. The results suggest that otolith opacity in Baltic cod is not associated with seasonal patterns in daily increment structure and that traditional age determination based on otolith opacity yields highly uncertain estimates of age.},

Sci. 46: 743-769), we present a statistical analysis of Schnute's size-structured model for exploited fish populations. Here we emphasize model parameters associated with fish growth. The model projects the growth of population biomass from the growth of individual fish. We show that this relationship between individual and global behavior is formally analogous with the kinetic theory of gases, where properties of a gas follow from the motions of individual particles. Our statistical analysis atlows for error in all observed variables, and we support all analytical arguments with simple graphical tech- niques. We illustrate the model with tag-recapture and fishery data from an exploited lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus) stock. Growth parameter estimates from the population are based on weight means and variances within the catch over the period 1956-86. These estimates agree well with estimates based on weights sf individual fish released in 1982 and recaptured in 1983.},

abstract = {The natural mortality of exploited fish populations is often assumed to be a species- specific constant independent of body size. This assumption has important implica- tions for size-based fish population models and for predicting the outcome of size- dependent fisheries management measures such as mesh-size regulations. To test the assumption, we critically review the empirical estimates of the natural mortality, M(year)1), of marine and brackish water fish stocks and model them as a function of von Bertalanffy growth parameters, L¥ (cm) and K (year)1), temperature (Kelvin) and length, L (cm). Using the Arrhenius equation to describe the relationship between Mand temperature, we find M to be significantly related to length, L¥ and K, but not to temperature (R2 = 0.62, P < 0.0001, n = 168). Temperature and K are signif- icantly correlated and when K is removed from the model the temperature term becomes significant, but the resulting model explains less of the total variance (R2 = 0.42, P < 0.0001, n = 168). The relationships between M, L, L¥, K and temperature are shown to be in general accordance with previous theoretical and empirical investigations. We conclude that natural mortality is significantly related to length and growth characteristics and recommend to use the empirical formula: ln(M) = 0.55 ) 1.61ln(L) + 1.44ln(L¥) + ln(K), for estimating the natural mortality of marine and brackish water fish.},

abstract = {This paper suggests ways forward from the widely perceived present failures of fishery assessment and management. A history of fishery yield modelling is presented from the carefree days of the 1950s to the depressing series of stock collapses and depletions of the 1980s. Underlying this gruesome story has been the failure of management by quotas to arrest overcapacity in fishing power, the lack of robust and informative reference points and the inadequacy of methods dealing with some multispecies fisheries. The paper refines the use of the concept of F-ext, defined as the minimum value of F in a self-regenerating yield model that leads to eventual extinction in a family of yield curves generated with a range of stock recruitment curves. Model reconstructions for North Sea cod and Icelandic herring make evident calamitous losses in catches forgone as result of the failure of rational management. An optimistic agenda that may achieve more effective fishery management in the future is presented. In some ways, we may have been trying to be too clever. A simple management system based on careful monitoring of fishing effort, biological targets such as F-95, and exploitation of a diversity of fish resources may suffice to avert further disaster and hedge against uncertainty. $\backslash$n},

abstract = {Interactions within and between species complicate quantification of climate effects, by causing indirect, often delayed, effects of climate fluctuations and compensation of mortality. Here we identify direct and indirect climate effects by analysing unique Russian time-series data from the Norwegian Sea-Barents Sea ecosystem on the first life stages of cod, capelin, herring and haddock, their predators, competitors and zooplanktonic prey. By analysing growth and survival from one life stage to the next (eggs-larvae-juveniles-recruits), we find evidence for both bottom-up, direct and top-down effects of climate. Ambient zooplankton biomass predicts survival of all species, whereas ambient temperature mainly affects survival through effects on growth. In warm years, all species experienced improved growth and feeding conditions. Cohorts born following a warm year will, however, experience increased predation and competition because of increased densities of subadult cod and herring, leading to delayed climate effects. While climate thus affects early growth and survival through several mechanisms, only some of the identified mechanisms were found to be significant predictors of population growth. In particular, our findings exemplify that climate impacts are barely propagated to later life stages when density dependence is strong.},

abstract = {Changes in fish distribution and climate in the North Atlantic have been observed for millennia by seafaring peoples, chronicled in many historical anecdotes, and recently studied systematically. For temperate to Arctic North Atlantic fish, a literature compendium of limits of temperature, salinity, and depth during feeding and spawning was used to investigate factors that influence distribution. Latitude and depth were negatively correlated with species number and density. Peak numbers of species feed at 0e4(C, but spawn at 2e7(C and salinities of 32.5e33.5. Principal components of feeding depths and temperatures suggested four groups of species: (i) small pelagics characterized by shallow habitat and cooler temperatures; (ii) most groundfish in deeper and warmer waters; (iii) warm-water large pelagics; and (iv) deepwater species. Spawning temperatures, salinities, depths, and timing produced groupings consistent with feeding components for pelagics, but differing for distant migrants such as tunas. Principal components (PCA) of spawning characteristics explained 56{\%} of the variance in species resilience (doubling time), while PCA of feeding characteristics explained only 23{\%}. We infer that the small pelagics capelin (Mallotus villosus) and herring (Clupea harengus) react strongly and quickly to climate change because of their physiological limits and potential for fast population growth. Verification comes from Icelandic and Greenland waters, which warmed considerably during 1920e1940, and where capelin, herring, cod (Gadus morhua), and other species shifted north very quickly.},

abstract = {For stocks which are considered “data-poor” no knowledge exist about growth, mortality or recruitment. The only available information is from catches. Here we examine the ability to assess the level of exploitation of a data-poor stock based only on information of the size of individuals in catches. The model is a formulation of the classic Beverton–Holt theory in terms of size where stock parameters describing growth, natural mortality, recruitment, etc. are determined from life-history invariants. A simulation study was used to compare the reliability of assessments performed under different information availability scenarios, from data-limited, where none of the parameters are known beforehand, to different degrees of information availability cases where one or more parameters are known. If no parameters are known it is possible to correctly assess whether the fishing mortality is below Fmsy in more than 60{\%} of the cases, and almost always correctly assess whether a stock is subject to overfishing. Adding information about age, i.e., assuming that growth rate and asymptotic size are known, does not improve the estimation. Only knowledge of the ratio between mortality and growth led to a considerable improvement in the assessment. Overall, the simulation study demonstrates that it may be possible to classify a data-poor stock as undergoing over- or under-fishing, while the exact status, i.e., how much the fishing mortality is above or below Fmsy, can only be assessed with a substantial uncertainty. Limitations of the approach are discussed.},

abstract = {Age determination and validation studies on deep-water marine fishes indicate they are difficult to age and often long-lived. Techniques for the determination of age in individual fish includes growth-zone analysis of vertebral centra, fin rays and spines, other skeletal structures, and otoliths (there are three sets of otoliths in most bony fish semicircular canals, each of which is made of calcium carbonate). Most have regular increments deposited as the fish (and its semicircular canals) grows. The most commonly used otolith for age determination is the largest one called the sagitta. Age validation techniques include: (1) tag–recapture, often combined with oxytetracycline injection and analysis in growth-zones of bone upon recapture; (2) analysis of growth-zones over time; and (3) radiometric approaches utilizing a known radioactive decay series as an independent chronometer in otoliths from bony fishes. We briefly summarize previous studies using these three validation approaches and present results from several of our radiometric studies on deep-water, bony fishes recently subjected to expanding fisheries. Radiometric age validation results are presented for four species of scorpaenid fishes (the bank, Sebastes rufus, and bocaccio, S. paucispinis, rockfishes, and two thornyhead species, Sebastolobus altivelis and S. alascanus). In addition, our analysis of scorpaenids indicates that longevity increases exponentially with maximum depth of occurrence. The reason that the deep-water forms of scorpaenid fishes are long-lived is uncertain. Their longevity, however, may be related to altered physiological processes relative to environmental parameters like low temperature, high pressures, low light levels, low oxygen, and poor food resources.},

abstract = {Identifying factors and processes influencing natural mortality is fundamental to the understanding of population dynamics. Metabolic theory of ecology and experimental studies at the cross-species level suggest the existence of general patterns linking natural mortality to body mass and temperature. However, there is scant evidence that similar relationships also hold at the intra-specific scale, possibly because of the relatively narrow range of sizes and temperatures experienced by most species and the effect of local adaptation, which can obscure links between temperature and vital rates. In this sense, the European eel Anguilla anguilla, a panmictic species with a wide distribution range, provides a paradigmatic case. We compiled data published in the past 30 years on eel mortality during the continental phase of the life cycle for 15 eel stocks and calibrated a general model for mortality, considering the effects of body mass, temperature, stock density and gender. Estimated activation energy (E = 1.2 eV) was at the upper extreme reported for metabolic reactions. Estimated mortality rates (ranging between 0.02 year(-1) at 8°C, low density and 0.47 year(-1) at 18°C, high density for a body mass of 100 g) were appreciably lower than those of most fishes, most likely due to the exceptionally low energy-consuming metabolism of eel.},

abstract = {The impact of the environment on interannual variability in fish recruitment has proven difficult to establish empirically, and environment-recruitment correlations have often been found to break down when more data become available. This may suggest that the statistical models have failed to capture the essential explanatory variables, or that environment-recruitment relationships are non-stationary, and thus actually change. The present paper explores the effect of climate, mea- sured by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), on the recruitment of North Atlantic cod Gadus morhua. The literature on the topic is reviewed and compared with results from a new analysis, in which data from all 22 main stocks are combined in 1 overall model. Results of the new analysis demonstrate (i) a geographic pattern in the effect of the NAO on recruitment, which resembles the geographic pattern of the correlation between the NAO and sea surface temperature, and (ii) trends in recruitment levels as well as in the effects of climate. These trends are not fully explainable through changes in spawning stock biomass. Summarizing the old and new insights, we arrive at the following general conclusions: NAO affects cod recruitment through local environmental variables such as sea temperature, salinity, oxygen, turbulence and advection. Cod recruitment is density- dependent, although the new analysis does not unequivocally support the existence of general pat- terns of density-dependent climate effects. There are trends in cod recruitment and in the relation- ship between climate and recruitment, possibly caused by demographic changes in the cod stocks (e.g. fishing-induced) and changes in the biotic or abiotic environment (regime shifts).},

abstract = {Evidence of the impacts of anthropogenic climate change on marine ecosystems is accumulating, but must be evaluated in the context of the “normal” climate cycles and variability which have caused fluctuations in fisheries throughout human history. The impacts on fisheries are due to a variety of direct and indirect effects of a number of physical and chemical factors, which include temperature, winds, vertical mixing, salinity, oxygen, pH and others. The direct effects act on the physiology, development rates, reproduction, behaviour and survival of individuals and can in some cases be studied experimentally and in controlled conditions. Indirect effects act via ecosystem processes and changes in the production of food or abundance of competitors, predators and pathogens. Recent studies of the effects of climate on primary production are reviewed and the consequences for fisheries production are evaluated through regional examples. Regional examples are also used to show changes in distribution and phenology of plankton and fish, which are attributed to climate. The role of discontinuous and extreme events (regime shifts, exceptional warm periods) is discussed. Changes in fish population processes can be investigated in experiments and by analysis of field data, particularly by assembling comparative data from regional examples. Although our existing knowledge is in many respects incomplete it nevertheless provides an adequate basis for improved management of fisheries and of marine ecosystems and for adapting to climate change. In order to adapt to changing climate, future monitoring and research must be closely linked to responsive, flexible and reflexive management systems.},

@article{Lester2004,
abstract = {We develop a model for somatic growth in fishes that explicitly allows for the energy demand imposed by reproduction. We show that the von Bertalanffy (VB) equation provides a good description of somatic growth after maturity, but not before. We show that the parameters of the VB equation are simple functions of age at maturity and reproductive investment. We use this model to show how the energy demands for both growth and reproduction trade off to determine optimal life-history traits. Assuming that both age at maturity and reproductive investment adapt to variations in adult mortality to maximize lifetime offspring production, our model predicts that: (i) the optimal age of maturity is inversely related to adult mortality rate; (ii) the optimal reproductive effort is approximately equal to adult mortality rate. These predictions are consistent with observed variations in the life-history traits of a large sample of iteroparous freshwater fishes.},

From Duplicate 2 ( 

Interpreting the von {\{}B{\}}ertalanffy model of somatic growth in fishes: the cost of reproduction

- Lester, N P; Shuter, B J; Abrams, P A )



It is interesting. Their basic claim is that somatic
growth is purely allometric (with exponent
2/3). When the fish mature, this is modified by a
constant proportion of the weight of the fish being
allocated to gonads per. year: the gonado-somatic
index, which we also use in our newer work. This,
they show, is equivalent to a von Bertalanffy growth
curve after maturity, with the parameters being
related to age at maturity and gonado-somatic
index. By using a constant mortality, they can then
solve for age-at-maturity, and by knowing
L{\_}infinity, they can find the gonado-somatic
index. This results in the gonado-somatic being a
function of the mortality, which I find somewhat
strange. They show a curve with the gonado-somatic
index being 0.7 for a mortality of 1 pr. year. They
also introduce seasons in their derivation, and show
how that leads to indeterminate growth. I do not
understand that part in detail (appendix B), but as
far as I can see it is basically a reinterpretation
of the gonado-somatic index; postulating a fixed
gonado-somatic index leads to part of the season
being used for somatic growth and part of the season
being used for growing gonads. I therefore see a
possibility of their conclusion being a tautologi:
they assume a constant gonado-somatic index, which
obviously leads to some of the growth being used for
somatic growth and some for gonads. This they
interpret as seasons, and then they say that seasons
are responsible for indeterminate growth. But it is
fairly obvious that the assumption of a constant
gonado-somatic index also leads to indeterminate
growth. In addition, the length of the growing
season disappears from their model, the only thing
left is the ration between the the time which is
used for somatic and gonadic growth ={\&}gt; it would give
the same results in an aseasonal environment.},

abstract = {The debate about the value of the allometric scaling exponent (b) relating metabolic rate to body mass (metabolic rate = a x mass(b)) is ongoing, with published evidence both for and against a 3/4-power scaling law continuing to accumulate. However, this debate often revolves around a dichotomous distinction between the 3/4-power exponent predicted by recent models of nutrient distribution networks and a 2/3 exponent predicted by Euclidean surface-area-to-volume considerations. Such an approach does not allow for the possibility that there is no single "true" exponent. In the present study, we conduct a meta-analysis of 127 interspecific allometric exponents to determine whether there is a universal metabolic allometry or if there are systematic differences between taxa or between metabolic states. This analysis shows that the effect size of mass on metabolic rate is significantly heterogeneous and that, on average, the effect of mass on metabolic rate is stronger for endotherms than for ectotherms. Significant differences between scaling exponents were also identified between ectotherms and endotherms, as well as between metabolic states (e.g., rest, field, and exercise), a result that applies to b values estimated by ordinary least squares, reduced major axis, and phylogenetically correct regression models. The lack of support for a single exponent model suggests that there is no universal metabolic allometry and represents a significant challenge to any model that predicts only a single value of b.},

The tagging data were classified into release groups by size at release, and a growth model was used to predict size at each time at liberty interval. Natural and fishing mortality rates were categorized by broad size-classes and estimated by maximum likelihood. The method incorporates a correc- tion for incomplete mixing of new releases. For each population, the natural mortality rate declined by about an order of magnitude over the initial size-classes. For skipjack and yellowfin tuna, there was also evidence of elevated natural mortality for some of the larger size-classes. Size- or age-related variability in natural mortality is likely to have impor- tant implications for tropical tuna stock assessment in the western Pacific.},

abstract = {Worldwide declines of fish stocks raise concerns about deleterious consequences of harvesting for stock abundances and individual life histories, and call for appropriate recovery strategies. Fishes in exploited stocks mature earlier at either larger or smaller sizes due to both genetic and plastic responses. The latter occur commonly when reduced competition for food leads to faster growth. Using a size-structured consumer-resource model, which accounts for both genetic and plastic responses, we show that fisheries-induced evolutionary changes in individual life history and stock properties can easily become irreversible. As a result of annual spawning, early maturation at small sizes and late maturation at large sizes can become alternative, evolutionarily and ecologically stable states under otherwise identical environmental conditions. Exploitation of late-maturing populations can then induce an evolutionary regime shift to smaller maturation sizes associated with stepwise, 1-year decreases in age at first reproduction. Complete and early fishing moratoria slowly reverse this process, but belated or partial closure of fisheries may accelerate or even instigate further evolution to smaller sizes at maturation. We suggest that stepwise decreases in maturation age can be used as early warnings of upcoming evolutionary changes, and should inspire timely restrictions of fisheries.},

Environmentally driven changes in bottom-up processes were projected to impact the survival and growth of eggs and larvae of these marine fish species in markedly different ways. We utilized a spatially explicit, individual-based model (IBM) to estimate larval fish survival and a 3D ecosystem model (ECOSMO) to provide variable prey fields. The model was applied to each of 3 years (1990, 1992, 1996) specifically characterized by interannual differences in water temperature in late winter and spring. Our results indicated that an important mechanism connecting environmental factors to larval fish survival was the match–mismatch dynamics of first-feeding larvae and their prey, which was species-specific because of (i) differences in the timing and locations of spawning, (ii)...},

abstract = {The effects of nonselective predation on the optimal
age and size of maturity of their prey tire
investigated using mathematical models of a simple
life history with juvenile and adult stages. Fitness
is measured by the product of survival ro the adult
stage and expected adult reproduction, which is
usually an increasing function of size at
maturity. Size is determined by both age at maturity
and the value of costly traits that increase mean
growth rate (growth effort), The analysis includes
cases with fixed size but flexible time to maturity,
fixed time but flexible size, and adaptively
flexible values of both variables. In these
analyses, growth effort is flexible. For comparison
with previous theory, models with a fixed growth
effort are analyzed, In each case, there may he
indirect effects of predation on the prey's food
supply. The effect of increased predation depends on
(I) which variables are flexible; (2) whether
increased growth effort requires increased exposure
to predators; and (3) how increased predator density
affects the abundance of Pc,od for juvenile prey; Ii
there is no indirect effect of predators on prey
food supply, size at maturity will generally
decrease in response to increased
predation. However, the indirect effect from
increased food has the opposite effect, and the net
result of predation is often increased size. Age at
maturity may either increase or decrease, depending
on functional forms and parameter values; this is
true regardless of the presence of indirect
effects. The results are compared with those of
previous theoretical analyses. Observed shifts in
life history in response to predation am reviewed,

abstract = {By estimating probabilistic reaction norms for age and size at maturation, we show that maturation schedules of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) off Labrador and Newfoundland shifted toward earlier ages and smaller sizes during the late 1980s and early 1990s, when these populations underwent a severe collapse in biomass and subsequently were closed for directed commercial fishing. We also demonstrate that this trend towards maturation at younger ages and smaller sizes is halted and even shows signs of reversal during the closure of the fisheries. In addition, our analysis reveals that males tend to mature earlier and at a smaller size than females and that maturation age and size decrease with increasing latitude. Importantly, the maturation reaction norms presented here are robust to variation in survival and growth (through phenotypic plasticity) and are thus strongly indicative of rapid evolutionary changes in cod maturation as well as of spatial and sex-specific genetic variation. We therefore suggest that maturation reaction norms can provide helpful reference points for managing harvested populations with evolving life histories.L'estimation de normes probabilistes de r{\'{e}}action pour l'{\^{a}}ge et la taille {\`{a}} la maturation nous permet de d{\'{e}}montrer que les calendriers de maturation de la morue franche (Gadus morhua) au large du Labrador et de Terre-Neuve ont gliss{\'{e}} vers des {\^{a}}ges plus pr{\'{e}}coces et des tailles plus basses au cours de la fin des ann{\'{e}}es 1980 et du d{\'{e}}but des ann{\'{e}}es 1990; {\`{a}} ce moment, ces populations ont connu un effondrement important de leur biomasse, apr{\`{e}}s quoi il y a eu interdiction de la p{\^{e}}che commerciale cibl{\'{e}}e.

abstract = {The recent decline in many fish stocks has been accompanied by marked changes in age at maturity. However, there is little information on whether other components of reproductive investment have changed and the relative roles of phenotypic plasticity or genetic selection in such change. This study explored how reproductive investment in cod Gadus morhua from different regions around Scotland has changed between a period of high (1969, 1970) and low (2002, 2003) spawning-stock size. Maturity ogives indicated that inshore North Sea cod now mature at a smaller size and younger age than they did around 1970. The relationship between potential fecundity and size indicated that cod in the inshore region are now more fecund than 30 yr ago. Cod from the inshore region of the North Sea now have a higher fecundity at a given size and age than cod from the offshore region and the west of Scotland. There was no such spatial trend around 1970. Simi- larly, whilst the relative fecundity of cod in recent times is positively correlated with age, no such relationship was evident in 1969 and 1970. Nutritional influences on maturity and fecundity, partic- ularly liver condition, were also evident from the recent study. However, the temporal and spatial differences in fecundity–size relationships were not consistent with a change in growth conditions, as there has been a significant decrease in body condition in recent times. Our findings regarding the temporal change in reproductive investment in the inshore North Sea region appear consistent with genotypic changes in life-history traits predicted to arise from intense periods of size-selective mortality.},

abstract = {Quantitative ecosystem indicators are needed to fulfill the mandate for ecosystem-based fisheries manage- ment. A variety of community metrics could potentially be used, but before reference levels for such indices can be established the sensitivity of candidate indices to fishing and other disturbances must be determined. One approach for obtaining such information is to test candidate indicators with models that mimic real ecosystems and can be manipu- lated experimentally. Here we construct a size-based multispecies model of a community of fish species that interact by predation. The model was parameterized for 21 fish species to obtain a predation-regulated community. Following an analysis of the sensitivity of the model to parameter uncertainty, we tested the sensitivity of community-level indicators to increasing levels of fishing mortality (F). Abundance and biomass spectra were sensitive to fishing mortality, with the slope decreasing with increasing F. Species diversity size spectra were also very sensitive to F, with diversity in the largest size classes declining rapidly. In contrast, k-dominance curves were less sensitive to fishing pressure. Impor- tantly, however, although most community-level metrics showed clear trends in response to fishing, single-species de- clines in spawning stock biomass were the most sensitive indicators of fishing effects.},

abstract = {Climate influences a population through a variety of processes, including reproduction, growth, migration patterns and phenology. Climate may operate either directly through metabolic and reproductive processes or indirectly through prey, predators, and competitors. One mechanism that may be particularly important, and which is the focus of this review, is the role of climate in affecting the reproductive success of a predator through its effect on the relative timing of food requirement and food availability during early life stages. This principle—the match or mismatch of predators’ requirement with resource availability—originated in the marine literature, where it ini- tially referred to how growth and survival of fish larvae (predator) depends on this production being synchronous with that of their main food items, i.e. early stage zooplankton (prey). Here we review how the match/mismatch hypothesis (MMH) is used to describe climate effects on ecological patterns and processes in both marine and terrestrial systems. In addition to studying match/mismatch sensu stricto, we expand on it to include effects of overall production level and the spatial aspect. Possible impacts of climate change on match/mismatch are examined in the context of one of the most appar- ent effects of global warming: an advancement of spring phenology. As a consequence of different species reacting dissimilarly, even minor changes in climate may invoke non-linear responses unbal- ancing established patterns of synchrony. All components of a food chain cannot be expected to shift their phenology at the same rate, and thus are unlikely to remain synchronous.},

abstract = {Selective harvest of large individuals should alter natural adaptive landscapes and drive evolution toward reduced somatic growth and increased reproductive investment. However, few studies have simultaneously considered the relative importance of artificial and natural selection in driving trait changes in wild populations. Using 50 years of individual-based data on Windermere pike (Esox lucius), we show that trait changes tracked the adaptive peak, which moved in the direction imposed by the dominating selective force. Individual lifetime somatic growth decreased at the start of the time series because harvest selection was strong and natural selection was too weak to override the strength of harvest selection. However, natural selection favoring fast somatic growth strengthened across the time series in parallel with the increase in pike abundance and, presumably, cannibalism. Harvest selection was overridden by natural selection when the fishing effort dwindled, triggering a rapid increase in pike somatic growth. The two selective forces appear to have acted in concert during only one short period of prey collapse that favored slow-growing pike. Moreover, increased somatic growth occurred concurrently with a reduction in reproductive investment in young and small female pike, indicating a tradeoff between growth and reproduction. The age-specific amplitude of this change paralleled the age-specific strength of harvest pressure, suggesting that reduced investment was also a response to increased life expectancy. This is the first study to demonstrate that a consideration of both natural selection and artificial selection is needed to fully explain time-varying trait dynamics in harvested populations.},

abstract = {A length-structured simulation model is presented as a tool in decision making for gillnet fisheries management. The analytical model simulates the fish population dynamics and impact of the fisheries, taking into account size-dependent spatial distribution patterns and migration of the fish. The daily recruitment of fish, at a theoretical starting length of 0 cm, is simulated with a variable temporal pattern, giving the model a high degree of generality and making it applicable to tropical situations where recruitment is not restricted to a short period in time. The model is sex-differentiated, the growth of the fish is determined by their length and the dispersion over the length-classes is controlled by the 'fractional boxcar train method'. Natural mortality is assumed constant for all exploited size classes. Fishing mortality is a function of fish length, based on a combination of gillnet selectivity curves for various mesh sizes. The fishing mortality for the most vulnerable size class is calibrated using estimates for the fishing mortality per length-class from length-based cohort analysis. Spatial distribution of the fish over different habitats is based on observed patterns in size-dependent habitat occupation. The realistic model provides predictions on the progressive effects of management regulations on numbers, size distributions and total biomass of the population and the catch in the various habitats. The commercial gillnet fishery for Oreochromis mossambicus (Cichlidae) in Tissawewa, a Sri Lankan reservoir, is used as an example. Simulation results correspond with independently estimated values for output parameters. Based on model predictions, conservation of this fishery is recommended by re-enforcement of the legal minimum mesh size of 76 mm stretched mesh, and a limitation of fishing effort to the present level. The model also provides predictions on the effects of subsidiary small-meshed fisheries for minor cyprinids on the existing fishery for O. mossambicus. Model predictions take into account the size-dependent spatial distribution patterns of the fish and the spatial allocation of the fishing effort.},

@article{Beyer1989,
abstract = {Recruitment is treated as the result of the development of a year-class through a series of particular stages. The basis of classical fish population dynamics is, therefore, presented in terms of age-specific and size-specific survival. The simple theory is extended to account for the fact that natural mortality exhibits a decreasing relationship with the size of the fish. With these ingredients, focus is placed on density-dependent growth and the relationship between ciassical recruirment curves and size-specific recruitment curves is clarified. The analysis draws upon a number of existing models and their modi fications. Two concepts of critical points on the size-specific rectuitment curve are introduced. Several examples are included to elucidate the dramatic effects of a consistent amount of food on the shape of the recruitment curve. The result of food and size specific recruitment is a stabilization of the recruit ment curve against variations in the mortaliry rate at medium to high levels of initial numbers of first feeding larvae. It is, rheoretically, possible that the year-class strength is already fixed during the first months of active life during which the individual fish larvae gain a factor of 100 in weight and are com pletely dependent on the production of copepod nauplii as food. Good year-classes can be explained by a combination of high food availability and iow mortality in the present theory. The focal point of the paper is ten elements of simple but general theory. Each theory block is cx plained by a Comment and an associated Exampie on how to use the theory. The size-based theory makes recruitment studies part of overall fishery population dynamics. Several new mortality concepts are introduced with implications for e.g. length-based fish stock assessment.},

abstract = {I present a computational approach to calculate the population growth rate, its sensitivity to life-history parameters and associated statistics like the stable population distribution and the reproductive value for exponentially growing populations, in which individual life history is described as a continuous development through time. The method is generally applicable to analyse population growth and performance for a wide range of individual life-history models, including cases in which the population consists of different types of individuals or in which the environment is fluctuating periodically. It complements comparable methods developed for discrete-time dynamics modelled with matrix or integral projection models. The basic idea behind the method is to use Lotka's integral equation for the population growth rate and compute the integral occurring in that equation by integrating an ordinary differential equation, analogous to recently derived methods to compute steady-states of physiologically structured population models. I illustrate application of the method using a number of published life-history models.},

@article{Hutchings1999,
abstract = {We quantified individual differences in Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua, reproductive behaviour at a field- reported spawning density under experimental conditions. Marked individuals (nine females, seven males) were observed twice daily and videotaped continuously for 9 weeks at ambient photoperiod and temperature in a large tank (60 m3). Agonistic interactions appeared to maintain a size-based dominance hierarchy among males. Multiple paternity per spawning bout, revealed by microsatellite DNA analysis, suggested a link between dominance and fertilization success. Interactions between sexes were dominated by the circling of females by males. Predicated by vertical separation from males, and after descending to the bottom, a motionless female would be circled up to 17 times, often by one male per circling bout but by several males throughout the spawning period. Although circling frequency increased with male dominance and male body size, initiation and termination of this behaviour appeared to be under female control. Circling provides opportunities for males to gain individual access to reproductive females and for females to assess the quality of potential mates. Our evidence for nonrandom mate choice and for male–male competition and display has implications for Atlantic cod mating systems and effects of fishing on their reproductive success.},

Multiple factors affecting growth and development in fish acted on this economically important stock over the same period including warming waters and an intensive fishery. Here, we employ North Sea cod as a model population, exploring how a physiologically relevant temperature metric (the growing degree-day, GDD; °C day) can be used to compare year-classes on a physiologically relevant time-scale, disentangling influences of climate (thermal history) on observed length-at-age trends. We conclude that the trends in North Sea cod length-at-age observed during the last three decades can be explained by a combination of temperature-dependent growth increases and a trend toward earlier maturation, the latter likely induced by the intensive fishing pressure, and possibly evidence of fisheries-induced evolution.},

abstract = {Direct and indirect community effects of rebuilding plans. - ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 1980-1988. Many fish communities are heavily exploited and rebuilding plans need to be implemented for depleted species. Within an ecosystem approach to management, development of rebuilding plans should include consideration of the expected consequences of the rebuilding of the target species on the rest of the marine community. Using size- and trait-based single-species and community models, a general assessment is made of the direct and indirect ecological consequences of a rebuilding plan based on a reduction in fishing mortality. If fishing mortality is sufficiently reduced, the time-scale of rebuilding is in the order of the time to reach maturation of an individual, and the expected trajectory can be reliably predicted by a single-species model. Indirect effects of increased abundance are a decrease in individuals in the trophic levels above and below the target species. The decrease in biomass of the neighbouring trophic levels is expected to be much smaller than the increase in the target species and to be largest in species on the trophic level above. We discuss which effects could be responsible when a rebuilding plan does not result in the expected increase and how our results could be applied in a practical management situation.},

abstract = {End-to-end models that represent ecosystem components from primary producers to top predators, linked through tro- phic interactions and affected by the abiotic environment, are expected to provide valuable tools for assessing the effects of climate change and fishing on ecosystem dynamics. Here, we review the main process-based approaches used for marine ecosystem modelling, focusing on the extent of the food web modelled, the forcing factors considered, the trophic processes represented, as well as the potential use and further development of the models. We consider models of a subset of the food web, models which represent the first attempts to couple low and high trophic levels, integrated models of the whole eco- system, and size spectrum models. Comparisons within and among these groups of models highlight the preferential use of functional groups at low trophic levels and species at higher trophic levels and the different ways in which the models account for abiotic processes. The model comparisons also highlight the importance of choosing an appropriate spatial dimension for representing organism dynamics. Many of the reviewed models could be extended by adding components and by ensuring that the full life cycles of species components are represented, but end-to-end models should provide full coverage of ecosystem components, the integration of physical and biological processes at different scales and two-way interactions between ecosystem components. We suggest that this is best achieved by coupling models, but there are very few existing cases where the coupling supports true two-way interaction. The advantages of coupling models are that the extent of discretization and representation can be targeted to the part of the food web being considered, making their development time- and cost-effective. Processes such as predation can be coupled to allow the propagation of forcing fac- tors effects up and down the food web. However, there needs to be a stronger focus on enabling two-way interaction, care- fully selecting the key functional groups and species, reconciling different time and space scales and the methods of converting between energy, nutrients and mass.},

The approach is based entirely on scientific survey data and on determination of the statistical distributions of the number of fish caught per haul in each length class. In our example, the negative binomial distribution is statistically accepted and linked to the population level through the new length-based model. The model is derived from the characteristics of continuous recruitment, individually based growth, and continuous, length-dependent mortality rates. Continuous recruitment with annually varying recruitment peaks and individually based growth was crucial for obtaining a model that could be statistically accepted. Natural mortality was estimated as well by the model. The model was applied to survey data for Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the Baltic. Its simple generic nature, as well as the validation procedure, is useful in studying and understanding life history and stock dynamics.},

How to validate a length-based model of single-species fish stock dynamics

- Kristensen, Kasper; Lewy, Peter; Beyer, Jan E )



Motivation: reliable predictions of fish stock dynamics. Validation of model complexity and estimating vital parameters with confidence intervals.


Model complexity validation done by testing statistical, hierarchical hypotheses. 


Basic hypothesis to be tested is the statistical distribution of CPUE by length. Can a Poisson model describe the observations, or should we used an overdispersed distribution (negative binomial distribution) 


Next step: test if a comprehensive stock dynamics model can be accepted. If yes simpler submodels can be tested.


Reasons for developing new approach to modelling length based fish stock dynamics: 
* Time and length continous model - avoid bias of discretization
* Continous recruitment, individual-based growth and temporal changes


Model complexity is tested by likelihood ratio test. 
Recruitment peak and variation allowed to change by year - estimated by the model.
Growth is modelled using VBGE assuming that each individual has its own asymptotic size.
Included length structured model for survey catchability and natural mortality.



Modelling the number density of the population




Assumptions: 
* Each individual follows its own growth pattern
* Mortality depends on size
* Continous recruitment


Dicrete recruitment

Analytical reference points for age-structured models: application to data-poor fisheries. {\^{a}}€“ ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 165{\^{a}}€“175.Analytical solutions for biological reference points are derived in terms of maximum lifetime reproductive rate. This rate can be calculated directly from biological parameters of maturity, fecundity, and natural mortality or a distribution for this rate can be derived from appropriate metadata. Minimal data needs and assumptions for determining stock status are discussed. The derivations lead to a re-parameterization of the common stock{\^{a}}€“recruit relationships, Beverton{\^{a}}€“Holt and Ricker, in terms of spawning potential ratio. Often, parameters in stock{\^{a}}€“recruit relationships are restricted by tight prior distributions or are fixed based on a hypothesized level of stock resilience. Fixing those parameters is equivalent to specifying the biological reference points. An ability to directly calculate reference points from biological data, or a meta-analysis, without need of a full assessment model or fisheries data, makes the method an attractive option for data-poor fisheries. The derivations reveal an explicit link between the biological characteristics of a species and appropriate management. Predicted stock status for a suite of shark species was compared with recent stock assessment results, and the method successfully identified whether each stock was overfished.},

abstract = {1. Climate change impacts have been observed on individual species and species subsets; however, it remains to be seen whether there are systematic, coherent assemblage-wide responses to climate change that could be used as a representative indicator of changing biological state. 2. European shelf seas are warming faster than the adjacent land masses and faster than the global average. We explore the year-by-year distributional response of North Sea bottom-dwelling (demersal) fishes to temperature change over the 25 years from 1980 to 2004. The centres of latitudinal and depth distributions of 28 fishes were estimated from species-abundance–location data collected on an annual fish monitoring survey. 3. Individual species responses were aggregated into 19 assemblages reflecting physiology (thermal preference and range), ecology (body size and abundance-occupancy patterns), biogeography (northern, southern and presence of range boundaries), and susceptibility to human impact (fishery target, bycatch and non-target species). 4. North Sea winter bottom temperature has increased by 1·6 ° C over 25 years, with a 1 ° C increase in 1988–1989 alone. During this period, the whole demersal fish assemblage deepened by {\~{}}3·6 m decade –1 and the deepening was coherent for most assemblages. 5. The latitudinal response to warming was heterogeneous, and reflects (i) a northward shift in the mean latitude of abundant, widespread thermal specialists, and (ii) the southward shift of relatively small, abundant southerly species with limited occupancy and a northern range boundary in the North Sea. 6. Synthesis and applications. The deepening of North Sea bottom-dwelling fishes in response to climate change is the marine analogue of the upward movement of terrestrial species to higher altitudes. The assemblage-level depth responses, and both latitudinal responses, covary with temperature and environmental variability in a manner diagnostic of a climate change impact. The deepening of the demersal fish assemblage in response to temperature could be used as a biotic indicator of the effects of climate change in the North Sea and other semi-enclosed seas.},

The direct effects on rates and behaviour can be studied experimentally and in the field, particularly with the advent of ever smarter tags for tracking fishes and their environment. Indirect effects due to changes in food, predators, parasites and diseases are much more difficult to estimate and predict. Climate can affect all life-history stages through direct and indirect processes and although the consequences in terms of growth, survival and reproductive output can be monitored, it is often difficult to determine the causes. Investigation of cod Gadus morhua populations across the whole North Atlantic Ocean has shown large-scale patterns of change in productivity due to lower individual growth and condition, caused by large-scale climate forcing. If a population is being heavily exploited then a drop in productivity can push it into decline unless the level of fishing is reduced: the idea of a stable carrying capacity is a dangerous myth. Overexploitation can be avoided by keeping fishing mortality low and by monitoring and responding rapidly to changes in productivity. There are signs that this lesson has been learned and that G. morhua will continue to be a mainstay of the human diet.},

abstract = {Fish population variability and fisheries activities are closely linked to weather and climate dynamics. While weather at sea directly affects fishing, environmental variability determines the distribution, migra- tion, and abundance of fish. Fishery science grew up during the last century by integrating knowledge from oceanography, fish biology, marine ecology, and fish population dynamics, largely focused on the great Northern Hemisphere fisheries. During this period, understanding and explaining interannual fish recruit- ment variability became a major focus for fisheries oceanographers. Yet, the close link between climate and fisheries is best illustrated by the effect of “unexpected” events—that is, nonseasonal, and sometimes catastrophic—on fish exploitation, such as those associated with the El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The observation that fish populations fluctuate at decadal time scales and show patterns of synchrony while being geographically separated drew attention to oceanographic processes driven by low-frequency signals, as reflected by indices tracking large-scale climate patterns such as the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). This low-frequency variability was first observed in catch fluctuations of small pelagic fish (anchovies and sardines), but similar effects soon emerged for larger fish such as salmon, various groundfish species, and some tuna species. Today, the availability of long time series of observations combined with major scientific advances in sampling and modeling the oceans’ ecosystems allows fisheries science to investigate processes generating variability in abundance, distribution, and dy- namics of fish species at daily, decadal, and even centennial scales. These studies are central to the research program of Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics (GLOBEC). This review presents examples of relation- ships between climate variability and fisheries at these different time scales for species covering various marine ecosystems ranging from equatorial to subarctic regions. Some of the known mechanisms linking climate variability and exploited fish populations are described, as well as some leading hypotheses, and their implications for their management and for the modeling of their dynamics. It is concluded with recommendations for collaborative work between climatologists, oceanographers, and fisheries scientists to resolve some of the outstanding problems in the development of sustainable fisheries.},

A stochastic process is defined in which organisms undergo jumps in body size as they catch and eat smaller organisms. Using a systematic expansion of the master equation, we derive a deterministic equation for the macroscopic dynamics, which we call the deterministic jump-growth equation, and a linear Fokker-Planck equation for the stochastic fluctuations. The McKendrick-von Foerster equation, used in previous studies, is shown to be a first-order approximation, appropriate in equilibrium systems where predators are much larger than their prey. The model has a power-law steady state consistent with the approximate constancy of mass density in logarithmic intervals of body mass often observed in marine ecosystems. The behaviours of the stochastic process, the deterministic jump-growth equation, and the McKendrick-von Foerster equation are compared using numerical methods. The numerical analysis shows two classes of attractors: steady states and travelling waves.},

We used a length-based model to estimate growth and mortality rates from June to October each year from 1988 to 1998. In this model, mortality and growth rates are decreasing functions of length and there is variability in individual growth. Maximum-likelihood methods were used to fit the model to length-frequency data collected by the Rhode Island Division of Fish and Wildlife beach-seine survey in Narragansett Bay during the study years. The monthly mortality rate was density dependent and was positively related to temperature. Growth rate was negatively related to density. There was a significant decline in YOY winter flounder abundance during the period of study. The most recent year of the study, 1998, had the lowest density, lowest mortality, low summer temperature, and high growth rate. Thus, growth and mortality during the juvenile stage do not appear to be limiting the recovery of this depleted winter flounder population.},

abstract = {Continuous types of population structure occur when continuous variables such as body size or habitat quality affect the vital parameters of individuals. These structures can give rise to complex population dynamics and interact with environmental conditions. Here we present a model for continuously structured populations with finite size, including both demographic and environmental stochasticity in the dynamics. Using recent methods developed for discrete age-structured models we derive the demographic and environmental variance of the population growth as functions of a continuous state variable. These two parameters, together with the expected population growth rate, are used to define a one-dimensional diffusion approximation of the population dynamics. Thus, a substantial reduction in complexity is achieved as the dynamics of the complex structured model can be described by only three population parameters. We provide methods for numerical calculation of the model parameters and demonstrate the accuracy of the diffusion approximation by computer simulation of specific examples. The general modeling framework makes it possible to analyze and predict future dynamics and extinction risk of populations with various types of structure, and to explore consequences of changes in demography caused by, e.g., climate change or different management decisions. Our results are especially relevant for small populations that are often of conservation concern.},

abstract = {Evidence has accumulated that climate variability influences the state and functioning of marine ecosystems. At the same time increasing pressure from exploitation and other human activities has been shown to impact exploited and non-exploited species and potentially modify ecosystem structure. There has been a tendency among marine scientists to pose the question as a dichotomy, i.e., whether (1) “natural” climate variability or (2) fishery exploitation bears the primary responsibility for population declines in fish populations and the associated ecosystem changes. However, effects of both climate and exploitation are probably substantially involved in most cases. More importantly, climate and exploitation interact in their effects, such that climate may cause failure in a fishery management scheme but that fishery exploitation may also disrupt the ability of a resource population to withstand, or adjust to, climate changes. Here, we review how exploitation, by altering the structure of populations and ecosystems, can modify their ability to respond to climate. The demographic effects of fishing (removal of large-old individuals) can have substantial consequences on the capacity of populations to buffer climate variability through various pathways (direct demographic effects, effects on migration, parental effects). In a similar way, selection of population sub-units within meta- populations may also lead to a reduction in the capacity of populations to withstand climate variability and change. At the ecosystem level, reduced complexity by elimination of species, such as might occur by fishing, may be destabilizing and could lead to reduced resilience to perturbations. Differential exploitation of marine resources could also promote increased turnover rates in marine ecosystems, which would exacerbate the effects of environmental changes. Overall (and despite the specificities of local situations) reduction in marine diversity at the individual, population and ecosystem levels will likely lead to a reduction in the resilience and an increase in the response of populations and ecosystems to future climate variability and change. Future management schemes will have to consider the structure and functioning of populations and ecosystems in a wider sense in order to maximise the ability of marine fauna to adapt to future climates.},

This may be a generality for tropical and cold-water fish. In their core habitat, yellowfin spawn continuously, year-round and from an early age, while northern cod mature only at middle-age and spawn only during a brief season. The resulting natural age structure of each species is well-adapted to the characteristic recruitment variability imposed by its habitat. Industrial fisheries managed by stock assessment models seem unavoidably to modify the age structure of cod so that very few spawning year-classes remain, though this does not seem to happen in yellowfin managed in a similar way. It is axiomatic that the natural age structure is that best fitted to the long-term survival of any species, and this fact implies that cold-water species exploited by an industrial fishery may be unable to sustain a viable population across periods when environmental stress is strong and recruitment weak: population collapses of cod and other cold-water fish under industrial fishing pressure may therefore be unavoidable.},

abstract = {Modern fisheries research and management must understand and take account of the interactions between climate and fishing, rather than try to disentangle their effects and address each separately. These interactions are significant drivers of change in exploited marine systems and have ramifications for ecosystems and those who depend on the services they provide.We discuss how fishing and climate forcing interact on individual fish, marine populations, marine communities, and ecosystems to bring these levels into states that are more sensitive to (i.e. more strongly related with) climate forcing. Fishing is unlikely to alter the sensitivities of individual finfish and invertebrates to climate forcing. It will remove individuals with specific characteristics from the gene pool, thereby affecting structure and function at higher levels of organisation. Fishing leads to a loss of older age classes, spatial contraction, loss of sub-units, and alteration of life history traits in populations, making them more sensitive to climate variability at interannual to interdecadal scales. Fishing reduces the mean size of individuals and mean trophic level of communities, decreasing their turnover time leading them to track environmental variability more closely. Marine ecosystems under intense exploitation evolve towards stronger bottom–up control and greater sensitivity to climate forcing. Because climate change occurs slowly, its effects are not likely to have immediate impacts on marine systems but will be manifest as the accumulation of the interactions between fishing and climate variability — unless threshold limits are exceeded. Marine resource managers need to develop approaches which maintain the resilience of individuals, populations, communities and ecosystems to the combined and interacting effects of climate and fishing. Overall, a less-heavily fished marine system, and one which shifts the focus from individual species to functional groups and fish communities, is likely to provide more stable catches with climate variability and change than would a heavily fished system.},

abstract = {The relationship between body mass (M) and metabolic rate (MR) typically accounts for most (>90{\%}) of the inter-specific variation in MR. As such, when measurement of a species of interest is not possible, its MR can often be predicted using M. However, choosing an appropriate relationship to make such predictions is critical, and the choice is complicated by ongoing debate about the structure of the relationship between M and MR. The present study examines a range of methods including ordinary least squares (OLS), reduced major axis (RMA), and phylogenetically-informed (PI) approaches for estimating log(MR) from log(M), as well as non-linear approaches for estimating the relationship between MR and M without the need for log-transformation. Using data for the basal metabolic rates of mammals, it is shown that RMA regression overestimates the scaling exponent of MR (b, where MR=aM(b)), suggesting that OLS regression is appropriate for these data. PI approaches are preferred over non-PI ones, and the best estimates of log(MR) are obtained by including information on body temperature, climate, habitat, island endemism, and use of torpor in addition to log(M). However, the use of log-transformed data introduces bias into estimates of MR, while the use of non-linear regression underestimates MR for small mammals. This suggests that no single relationship is appropriate for describing the relationship between MR and M for all mammals, and that relationships for more narrow taxonomic groups or body mass ranges should be used when predicting MR from M.},

abstract = {Global warming impacts virtually all biota and ecosystems. Many of these impacts are mediated through direct effects of temperature on individual vital rates. Yet how this translates from the individual to the population level is still poorly understood, hampering the assessment of global warming impacts on population structure and dynamics. Here, we study the effects of temperature on intraspecific competition and cannibalism and the population dynamical consequences in a size-structured fish population. We use a physiologically structured consumer-resource model in which we explicitly model the temperature dependencies of the consumer vital rates and the resource population growth rate. Our model predicts that increased temperature decreases resource density despite higher resource growth rates, reflecting stronger intraspecific competition among consumers. At a critical temperature, the consumer population dynamics destabilize and shift from a stable equilibrium to competition-driven generation cycles that are dominated by recruits. As a consequence, maximum age decreases and the proportion of younger and smaller-sized fish increases. These model predictions support the hypothesis of decreasing mean body sizes due to increased temperatures. We conclude that in size-structured fish populations, global warming may increase competition, favor smaller size classes, and induce regime shifts that destabilize population and community dynamics.},

In particular, it has been proposed that age truncation induced by fisheries exploitation may increase the population’s sensitivity to climate. In this study, we use unique long-term abundance data for the Northeast Arctic stock of cod (Gadus morhua) and the Norwegian Spring- Spawning stock of herring (Clupea harengus), which we analyze using techniques based on age-structured population matrices. After identifying time periods with different age distributions in the spawning stock, we use linear models to quantify the relative effect of exploitation and temperature on the population growth rates. For the two populations, age truncation was found to be associated with an increasing importance of temperature and a relatively decreasing importance of exploitation, while the population growth rate became increasingly sensitive to recruitment variations. The results suggested that the removal of older age classes reduced the buffering capacity of the population, thereby making the population growth rate more dependent on recruitment than adult survival and increasing the effect of environmental fluctuations. Age structure appeared as a key characteristic that can affect the response of fish stocks to climate variations and its consequences may be of key importance for conservation and management.},

Possible submodels include not only asymptotic growth (such as von Bertalanffy, Richards, Gsmpertz, or logistic growth) but also linear, quadratic, or exponential growth. By simple analysis of variance, the observed data can be used directly in deciding which type of model is most appropriate. The new model is cast in terms of parameters which have stable statistical estimates.

abstract = {There are a large number of commercially exploited stocks lacking quantitative assessments and reliable estimates of stock status. Providing MSY-based advice for these data-limited stocks remains a challenge for fisheries science. For many data-limited stocks, catch length composition and/or survey biomass indices or catch-per-unit effort (cpue) are available. Information on life history traits may also be available or borrowed from similar species/stocks. In this work we present three harvest control rules (HCRs), driven by indicators derived from key monitoring data. These were tested through simulation using two exploitation scenarios (development and over-exploitation) applied to 50 stocks (pelagic, demersal, deep sea species and Nephrops). We examine the performance of the HCRs to deliver catch-based advice that is risk adverse and drives stocks to MSY. The HCR with a biomass index-adjusted status quo catch, used to provide catch-based advice for several European data-limited stocks, showed the poorest performance, keeping the biomass at low or very low levels. The HCRs that adjust the status quo catch based on the variability of the biomass index time series was able to drive most of the stocks to MSY, showing low to moderate biological risk. The recovery of biomass required asymmetric confidence intervals for the biomass index and larger decreases in status quo catch than increases. The HCR based on length reference points as proxies for the FSQ/FMSY ratio was able to reverse the decreasing trend in biomass but with levels of catch below MSY. This HCR did not prevent some of the stocks declining when subject to over-exploitation. For data-limited stocks, the empirical HCRs tested in this work can provide the basis for catch advice. Nevertheless, applications to real life cases require simulation testing to be carried out to tune the HCRs. Our approach to simulation testing can be used for such analysis.},

Here we report a case study on how striving for higher yields from the Eastern Baltic cod stock by increasing selectivity has become exceedingly detrimental for its productivity. Although there is a successive increase in numbers of undersized fish, growth potential is severely reduced, and fishing mortality in fishable size has increased. Once density-dependent growth is introduced, the process is self-enforcing as long as the recruitment remains stable. Our findings suggest that policies focusing on maximum yield while targeting greater sizes are risky and should instead prioritize catch rates over yield.

total evolutionary change in mean phenotype that
occurs in the presence of fitness variation can be
partitioned exactly into five components
representing logically distinct processes. One
component is the linear response to selection, as
represented by the breeder's equation of
quantitative genetics. but with heritability defined
as the linear regression coefficient of mean
offspring phenotype on parent phenotype. The other
components are identified as constitutive
transmission bias, two types of induced transmission
bias. and a spurious response to selection caused by
a covariance between parental fitness and offspring
phenotype that cannot be predicted from parental
phenotypes. The partitioning can be accomplished in
two ways, one with heritability measured before (in
the absence of) selection, and the other with
heritability measured after (in the presence of)
selection. Measuring heritability after selection,
though unconventional, yields a representation for
the linear response to selection that is most
consistent with Darwinian evolution by natural
selection because the response to selection is
determined by the reproductive features of the
selected group, not of the parent population as a
whole. The analysis of an explicitly Mendelian model
shows that the relative contributions of the five
terms to the total evolutionary change depends on
the level of organization (gene, individual, or
mated pair) at which the parent population is
divided into phenotypes, with each frame of
reference providing unique insight. It is shown that
all five components of phenotypic evolution will
generally have nonzero values as a result of various
combinations of the normal features of Mendelian
populations, including biparental sex, allelic
dominance, inbreeding, epistasis, linkage
disequilibrium, and environmental covariances
between traits. Additive genetic variance can be a
poor predictor of the adaptive response to selection
in these models. The narrow-sense heritability

Fisheries-induced evolution of exploited populations has recently become a subject of concern for policy makers, fisheries managers, and the general public, with prominent calls for mitigating management action.

Rates of evolution are expected to be approximately 0.1-0.6{\%} per year, and the consequent reductions in fisheries yield are <0.7{\%} per year. These rates are at least a factor of 5 lower than published values based on experiments and analyses of population time series, and we explain why the published rates may be overestimates. Dealing with evolutionary effects of fishing is less urgent than reducing the direct detrimental effects of overfishing on exploited stocks and on their marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {There are differences in perception of the status of fisheries around the world that may partly stem from how data on trends in catches over time have been used. On the basis of catch trends, it has been suggested that about 70{\%} of all stocks are overexploited due to unsustainable harvesting and 30{\%} of all stocks have collapsed to <10{\%} of unfished levels. Catch trends also suggest that over time an increasing number of stocks will be overexploited and collapsed. We evaluated how use of catch data affects assessment of fisheries stock status. We analyzed simulated random catch data with no trend. We examined well-studied stocks classified as collapsed on the basis of catch data to determine whether these stocks actually were collapsed. We also used stock assessments to compare stock status derived from catch data with status derived from biomass data. Status of stocks derived from catch trends was almost identical to what one would expect if catches were randomly generated with no trend. Most classifications of collapse assigned on the basis of catch data were due to taxonomic reclassification, regulatory changes in fisheries, and market changes. In our comparison of biomass data with catch trends, catch trends overestimated the percentage of overexploited and collapsed stocks. Although our biomass data were primarily from industrial fisheries in developed countries, the status of these stocks estimated from catch data was similar to the status of stocks in the rest of the world estimated from catch data. We conclude that at present 28-33{\%} of all stocks are overexploited and 7-13{\%} of all stocks are collapsed. Additionally, the proportion of fished stocks that are overexploited or collapsed has been fairly stable in recent years.},

abstract = {Biological processes and physical oceanography are often integrated in numerical modelling of marine fish larvae, but rarely in statistical analyses of spatio-temporal observation data. Here, we examine the relative contribution of inter-annual variability in spawner distribution, advection by ocean currents, hydrography and climate in modifying observed distribution patterns of cod larvae in the Lofoten-Barents Sea. By integrating predictions from a particle-tracking model into a spatially explicit statistical analysis, the effects of advection and the timing and locations of spawning are accounted for. The analysis also includes other environmental factors: temperature, salinity, a convergence index and a climate threshold determined by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). We found that the spatial pattern of larvae changed over the two climate periods, being more upstream in low NAO years. We also demonstrate that spawning distribution and ocean circulation are the main factors shaping this distribution, while temperature effects are different between climate periods, probably due to a different spatial overlap of the fish larvae and their prey, and the consequent effect on the spatial pattern of larval survival. Our new methodological approach combines numerical and statistical modelling to draw robust inferences from observed distributions and will be of general interest for studies of many marine fish species.},

These effects operate through local weather parameters such as temperature, wind, rain, snow, and ocean currents, as well as interactions among these. In the temperate zone, local variations in weather are often coupled over large geographic areas through the transient behavior of atmospheric planetary-scale waves. These variations drive temporally and spatially averaged exchanges of heat, momentum, and water vapor that ultimately determine growth, recruitment, and migration patterns. Recently, there have been several studies of the impact of large-scale climatic forcing on ecological systems. We review how two of the best-known climate phenomena-the North Atlantic Oscillation and the El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation-affect ecological patterns and processes in both marine and terrestrial systems.},

abstract = {To evaluate interstock differences in condition, it would be advantageous to develop stock-level condition indices from standardized databases on weight and length. This study describes a method for estimating stock-level condition when individual-level observations on length and weight are not easily accessible. For each year in a 56-year time series (1946–2001) for Northeast Arctic cod (Gadus morhua), pseudo-observations of weight and length were gen- erated by pairing the Norwegian and Russian values for weight-at-age provided annually to the assessment working group with estimates of length-at-age derived from the same databases. A weight–length relationship fit to each year was then used to predict weight-at-length, i.e., girth, for a range of standard lengths (30–120 cm). This index was uncorrelated with both the liver condition index and the abundance of Barents Sea capelin (Mallotus villosus), suggest- ing that at the stock level, the girth of cod is not necessarily indicative of the magnitude of stored energy reserves. Partitioning body size into length-at-age and girth revealed long-term trends in body size. In particular, large/old cod showed substantially higher values of both length-at-age and girth that could be the result of long-term increases in fishing mortality.},

Effects of climatological and oceanographic variables, such as temperature, sea ice, turbulence, and advection, on marine organisms are discussed in terms of their influence on growth, distribution, reproduction, activity rates, recruitment and mortality. Organisms tend to be limited to specific thermal ranges with experimental findings showing that sufficient oxygen supply by ventilation and circulation only occurs within these ranges. Indirect effects of climate forcing through effects on the food web are also discussed.

abstract = {I present a model of stochastic community dynamics in which death occurs randomly in the community, propagules disperse randomly from a regional pool, and recruitment of new individuals of a species is proportional to the species local abundance multiplied by its local competitive ability. The competitive ability of a species is assumed to be determined by a function of one trait of the species, and I call this function the environmental filtering function. I show that information on local species abundances in a network of plots, together with trait data for each species, enables the inference of both the immigration rate and the environmental filtering function in each plot. I further study how the diversity patterns produced by this model deviate from the neutral predictions, and how this deviation depends on the characteristics of the environmental filtering function. I show that this inference framework is more powerful at detecting trait-based environmental filtering than existing statistical approaches based on trait distributions, and discuss how the predictions of this model could be used to assess environmental heterogeneity in a plot, to detect functionally meaningful trade-offs among species traits, and to test the assumption that there exists a simple relationship between species traits and local competitive ability.},

abstract = {This review is based on 58 climate- fisheries models published over the last 28 years that describe the impacts of fishery pressure and environ- mental variability on populations and ecosystems and include basic principles of population dynamics. It points out that the incorporation of environmental factors in fishery models has already been done and is of great importance for future models used in the assessment of marine resources. The work is guided by the questions to what extent have these models a) enhanced our understanding of the interrelationships between the environment, the fishery and the state of the exploited resources and b) helped to improve the prediction of population dynamics and the assessment of marine resources. For each of the six most commonly used model categories a case study is critically analyzed. The problems of ‘‘breaking relationships’’ between environmental factors and the biological response used in models, the trade-off between model complexity (realism) and simplicity (data availability) and the potential of multivariate climate indices for forecasting ecosystem states and for use as proxies for combined models are discussed, as are novel non-linear and spatially explicit model- ing approaches. Approaches differ in terms of model complexity, use of linear or non-linear equations, number of parameters, forecast time horizon and type of resource modelled. A majority of the models were constructed for fish and invertebrate stocks of the northeast Pacific and the epicontinental seas of the Atlantic, reflecting the advancement of fisheries science in these regions. New, in parts highly complex models and sophisticated approaches were identified. The reviewed studies demonstrate that the performance of fished stocks can better be described if environmental or climatic variability is incorpo- rated into the fisheries models. We conclude that due to the already available knowledge, the greatly enhanced computer power, new methods and recent findings of large-scale climatic/oceanographic cycles, fisheries modeling should progress greatly in the coming years.},

abstract = {Most of the traditional assessment models are age-structured. However, many biological and exploitation processes are more length-dependent than age-dependent, and the required length–age conversion of available data is often not reliable. Consequently, length-structured or age–length structured models have undergone considerable development in recent years. The growth transition matrix used to model the mean growth and growth variability of the population, is of primary importance in a length-structured matrix model. Building this growth transition matrix is not trivial and it is necessary to assess the impact that various assumptions may have to identify robust model structures. In this study, we assess the effects of (1) time and length discretisation, (2) the distribution of individuals within length classes and (3) the statistical distribution used to describe growth variability, by fitting a growth matrix model to individual quasi-continuous simulated growth data. The study quantitatively demonstrates that the choice of the time step and of length class width is the key point when building a length-structured population growth model. The use of a gamma distribution for the growth increments and/or a uniform distribution of individuals within length classes were found to make the model more robust.},

@article{Daan2005,
abstract = {We investigate changes in the North Sea fish community with particular reference to possible indirect effects of fishing, mediated through the ecosystem. In the past, long-term changes in the slope of size spectra of research vessel catches have been related to changes in fishing effort, but such changes may simply reflect the cumulative, direct effects of fishing through selective removal of large individuals. If there is resilience in a fish community towards fishing, we may expect increases in specific components, for instance as a consequence of an associated reduction in predation and/or competition. We show on the basis of three long-term trawl surveys that abundance of small fish (all species) as well as abundance of demersal species with a low maximum length (Lmax) have steadily and significantly increased in absolute numbers over large parts of the North Sea during the last 30 years. Taking average fishing mortality of assessed commercial species as an index of exploitation rate of the fish community, it appears that fishing effort reached its maximum in the mid-1980s and has declined slightly since. If the observed changes in the community are caused by indirect effects of fishing, there must be a considerable delay in response time, because the observed changes generally proceed up to recent years, although both size and Lmax spectra suggest some levelling off, or even recovery in one of the surveys. Indeed, significant correlations between all community metrics and exploitation rate were obtained only if time lags R6 years were introduced.},

@article{Overland2010,
abstract = {This paper discusses large-scale climate variability for several marine ecosystems and suggests types of ecosystem responses to climate change. Our analysis of observations and model results for the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans concludes that most climate variability is accounted for by the combination of intermittent 1–2 year duration events, e.g. the cumulative effect of monthly weather anomalies or the more organized El Ni{\~{n}}o/La Ni{\~{n}}a, plus broad-band “red noise” intrinsic variability operating at decadal and longer timescales. While ocean processes such as heat storage and lags due to ocean circulation provide some multi-year memory to the climate system, basic understanding of the mechanisms resulting in observed large decadal variability is lacking and forces the adoption of a “stochastic or red noise” conceptual model of low frequency variability at the present time. Thus we conclude that decadal events with rapid shifts and major departures from climatic means will occur, but their timing cannot be forecast. The responses to climate by biological systems are diverse in character because intervening processes introduce a variety of amplifications, time lags, feedbacks, and non-linearities. Decadal ecosystem variability can involve a variety of climate to ecosystem transfer functions. These can be expected to convert red noise of the physical system to redder (lower frequency) noise of the biological response, but can also convert climatic red noise to more abrupt and discontinuous biological shifts, transient climatic disturbance to prolonged ecosystem recovery, and perhaps transient disturbance to sustained ecosystemregimes. All of these ecosystemresponse characteristics are likely to be active for at least some locations and time periods, leading to a mixof slowfluctuations, prolonged trends, and step-like changes in ecosystems and fish populations in response to climate change. Climate variables such as temperatures and winds can have strong teleconnections (large spatial covariability) within individual ocean basins, but between-basin teleconnections, and potential climate-driven biological synchrony over several decades, are usually much weaker and a highly intermittent function of the conditions prevailing at the time within the adjoining basins. As noted in the recent IPCC 4th Assessment Report, a warming trend of ocean surface layers and loss of regional sea ice is likely before 2030, due to addition of greenhouse gases. Combined with large continuing natural climate variability, this will stress ecosystems in ways that they have not encountered for at least 100s of years. Published},

Aquaculture, despite a falling growth rate in recent years, remains the fastest-growing animal-food-producing sector and is set to overtake capture fisheries as a source of food fish. Overall production of the sector continues to grow. This publication analyses and reviews the latest available global statistics and trends in fisheries and aquaculture. It explores the important, yet often underestimated, role of inland fisheries, particularly in many small communities where they make a vital contribution to poverty alleviation and livelihood security. A broader look at the issues affecting fisheries and aquaculture emphasizes the growing need to focus on the many facets of policy and governance and examines the impacts of climate change, biodiversity loss, quality certification and product traceability on the sector},

abstract = {Many criteria for statistical parameter estimation, such as maximum likelihood, are formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem. Automatic Differentiation Model Builder (ADMB) is a programming framework based on automatic differentiation, aimed at highly nonlinear models with a large number of parameters. The benefits of using AD are computational efficiency and high numerical accuracy, both crucial in many practical problems. We describe the basic components and the underlying philosophy of ADMB, with an emphasis on functionality found in no other statistical software. One example of such a feature is the generic implementation of Laplace approximation of high-dimensional integrals for use in latent variable models. We also review the literature in which ADMB has been used, and discuss future development of ADMB as an open source project. Overall, the main advantages of ADMB are flexibility, speed, precision, stability and built-in methods to quantify uncertainty.},

abstract = {The nature and significance of size preference for fish prey in the diet selection of North Sea cod (Gadus morhua L.) was analysed. The analysis combined information on size-specific abundance derived from bottom trawl surveys with prey size frequencies in cod stomachs from the International North Sea Stomach Database. To estimate the abundance of all potential fish prey in the sea, a length-based number spectrum was calculated, corrected for gear efficiency by the application of a species-specific correction factor, and weighted by local predator abundance to take the spatial–temporal overlap between cod and its prey into consideration. A prey size preference model for cod feeding on fish is presented. Results showed that the preferred predator-to-prey weight ratio is an exponentially increasing func- tion of predator size and an exponentially decreasing function of the slope of the number spectrum. More than 75{\%} of fish found in the stomachs of North Sea cod originated from the least preferred quartile of the prey size range, indicat- ing that prey abundance is the main determinant of the diet composition.},

abstract = {We develop the theory of biphasic somatic growth in fish using models based on the distinction between pre- and post-maturation growth and an explicit description of energy allocation within a growing season. We define a 'generic biphasic' (GB) model that assumes post-maturation growth has a von Bertalanffy (vB) form. For this model we derive an explicit expression for the gonad weight/somatic weight ratio (g) which may either remain fixed or vary with size. Optimal biphasic models are then developed with reproductive strategies that maximise lifetime reproductive output. We consider two optimal growth models. In the first (fixed g optimal), gonad weight is constrained to be proportional to somatic weight. In the second (variable g optimal) model, allocation to reproduction is unconstrained and g increases with size. For the first of these two models, adult growth in a scaled measure of length has the exact vB form. When there are no constraints on allocation, growth is vB to a very good approximation. In both models, pre-maturation growth is linear. In a companion paper we use growth data from lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) to test the bioenergetics assumptions used to develop these models, and demonstrate that they have advantages over the vB model, both in quality of fit, and in the information contained in the fitted parameters.},

abstract = {Effects of global warming on animal distribution and performance become visible in many marine ecosystems. The present study was designed to develop a concept for a cause and effect understanding with respect to temperature changes and to explain ecological findings based on physiological processes. The concept is based on a wide comparison of invertebrate and fish species with a special focus on recent data obtained in two model species of fish. These fish species are both characterized by northern and southern distribution limits in the North Atlantic: eelpout (Zoarces viviparus), as a typical non-migrating inhabitant of the coastal zone and the cod (Gadus morhua), as a typical inhabitant of the continental shelf with a high importance for fisheries. Mathematical modellingdemonstrates a clear significant correlation between climate induced temperature fluctuations and the recruitment of cod stocks. Growth performance in cod is optimal at temperatures close to 101C, regardless of the population investigated in a latitudinal cline. However, temperature specific growth rates decrease at higher latitudes. Also, fecundity is less in White Sea than in North and Baltic Sea cod or eelpout populations. These findings suggest that a cold-induced shift in energy budget occurs which is unfavorable for growth performance and fecundity. Thermal tolerance limits shift depending on latitude and are characterized by oxygen limitation at both low or high temperatures. Oxygen supply to tissues is optimized at low temperature by a shift in hemoglobin isoforms and oxygen binding properties to lower affinities and higher unloading potential. Protective stimulation of heat shock protein synthesis was not observed. Accordingto a recent model of thermal tolerance the downward shift of tolerance limits duringcold adaptation is associated with risingmitochondrial densities and, thus, aerobic capacity and performance in the cold, especially in eurythermal species. At the same time the costs of mitochondrial maintenance reflected by mitochondrial proton leakage should rise leaving a lower energy fraction for growth and reproduction. The preliminary conclusion can be drawn that warmingwill cause a northern shift of distribution limits for both species with a rise in growth performance and fecundity larger than expected from the Q10 effect in the north and lower growth or even extinction of the species in the south. Such a shift may heavily affect fishingactivities in the North Sea.},

@article{Kinnison2001,
abstract = {We compiled a database of microevolution on
contemporary time scales in nature (47 source
articles; 30 animal species), comprising 2649
evolutionary rates in darwins (proportional change
per million years) and 2151 evolutionary rates in
haldanes (standard deviations per generation). Here
we demonstrate how quantitative rate measures can
provide general insights into patterns and processes
of evolution. The frequency distribution of
evolutionary rates was approximately log-normal,
with many slow rates and few fast rates. Net
selection intensities estimated from haldanes were
on average lower than selection intensities commonly
measured directly in natural populations. This
difference suggests that natural selection could
easily accomplish observed microevolution but that
the intensities of selection typically measured in
nature are rarely maintained for long (otherwise
observed evolutionary rates would be higher). Traits
closely associated with fitness (life history
traits) appear to evolve at least as fast as traits
less closely tied to fitness (morphology). The
magnitude of evolutionary difference increased with
the length of the time interval, particularly when
maximum rates from a given study were
considered. This pattern suggests a general
underlying tendency toward increasing evolutionary
diversification with time. However, evolutionary
rates also tended to decrease with time, perhaps
because longer time intervals average increasingly
disparate rates over time, or because evolution
slows when populations approach new optima or as
genetic variation is depleted. In combination, our
results suggest that macroevolutionary transitions
may ultimately arise through microevolution
occasionally 'writ large' but are perhaps temporally
characterized by microevolution 'writ in fits and
starts'.},

@article{Makarieva2008,
abstract = {A fundamental but unanswered biological question asks how much energy, on average, Earth's different life forms spend per unit mass per unit time to remain alive. Here, using the largest database to date, for 3,006 species that includes most of the range of biological diversity on the planet-from bacteria to elephants, and algae to sapling trees-we show that metabolism displays a striking degree of homeostasis across all of life. We demonstrate that, despite the enormous biochemical, physiological, and ecological differences between the surveyed species that vary over 10(20)-fold in body mass, mean metabolic rates of major taxonomic groups displayed at physiological rest converge on a narrow range from 0.3 to 9 W kg(-1). This 30-fold variation among life's disparate forms represents a remarkably small range compared with the 4,000- to 65,000-fold difference between the mean metabolic rates of the smallest and largest organisms that would be observed if life as a whole conformed to universal quarter-power or third-power allometric scaling laws. The observed broad convergence on a narrow range of basal metabolic rates suggests that organismal designs that fit in this physiological window have been favored by natural selection across all of life's major kingdoms, and that this range might therefore be considered as optimal for living matter as a whole.},

abstract = {The interplay between temperature-related processes and predation in determining age-1 recruitment strength be- tween 1992 and 2006 was analysed for North Sea cod (Gadus morhua) and Norway pout (Trisopterus esmarkii). For this purpose, an predation impact index (PI) was calculated out of survey data. PI was assumed to depend on the abundance of the predators and on the spatial overlap between predator and prey populations. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were created with spawning stock biomass (SSB) and sea surface temperature (SST) in the respective spawning and nurs- ery areas and PI as explaining variables. SSB had no significant impact on recruitment during this time period for both species. SSTs during spring and PI explained the interannual variability in recruitment strength to a large extent (88{\%} of the total variance for cod and 68{\%} for Norway pout). The SST during spring determined the overall level of recruitment. At SSTs above a certain level, however, the effect on recruitment was no longer significant. In these temperature ranges, predation was the dominant effect. Therefore, the fate of North Sea cod and Norway pout stocks under global-warming conditions will be strongly influenced by the status of the North Sea food web.},

abstract = {This paper derives optimal life histories for fishes or other animals in relation to the size spectrum of the ecological community in which they are both predators and prey. Assuming log-linear size-spectra and well known scaling laws for feeding and mortality, we first construct the energetics of the individual. From these we find, using dynamic programming, the optimal allocation of energy between growth and reproduction as well as the trade-off between offspring size and numbers. Optimal strategies were found to be strongly dependent on size spectrum slope. For steep size spectra (numbers declining rapidly with size), determinate growth was optimal and allocation to somatic growth increased rapidly with increasing slope. However, restricting reproduction to a fixed mating season changed optimal allocations to give indeterminate growth approximating a von Bertalanffy trajectory. The optimal offspring size was as small as possible given other restrictions such as newborn starvation mortality. For shallow size spectra, finite optimal maturity size required a decline in fitness for large size or age. All the results are compared with observed size spectra of fish communities to show their consistency and relevance.},

abstract = {The metabolic theory of ecology links physiology with ecology, and successfully predicts many allometric scaling relationships. In recent years, proponents and critics of metabolic theory have debated vigorously about the scaling of metabolic rate. We show that the controversy arose, in part, because researchers examined the mean exponent separately from the variance. We estimate both quantities simultaneously using linear mixed-effects models and data from 1242 animal species. Metabolic rate scaling converges on the predicted value of 3/4 but is highly heterogeneous: 50{\%} of orders lie outside the range 0.68-0.82. These findings are robust to several forms of statistical uncertainty. We then test competing hypotheses about the variation. Metabolic theory is currently unable to explain differences in scaling among orders, but the patterns are not consistent with competing explanations either. We conclude that current theories are inadequate to explain the full range of metabolic scaling patterns observed in nature.},

Size-selective fishing drives species composition in the Celtic Sea. - ICES Journal of Marine Science, 69: 223-234. Fishing alters community size structure by selectively removing larger individual fish and by changing the relative abundance of different-sized species. To assess the relative importance of individual- and species-level effects, two indices of fish community structure were compared, the relative abundance of large fish individuals (large fish indicator, LFI) and the relative abundance of large fish species (large species indicator, LSI). The two indices were strongly correlated for empirical data from the Celtic Sea and for data from simulated model communities, suggesting that much of the variability in the LFI is caused by shifts in the relative abundance of species (LSI). This correlation is explained by the observation that most of the biomass of a given species is spread over few length classes, a range spanning the factor 2 of individual length, such that most species contributed predominantly to either the small or the large component of the LFI. The results suggest that the effects of size-selective fishing in the Celtic Sea are mediated mainly through changes in community composition.},

@article{Ratz2003,
abstract = {A comparative analysis of the fish condition (Fulton's K) of 10 cod stocks in the north Atlantic in relation to the temperature of their habitat, growth rates and their reproductive potential is presented. It is shown that the cod stocks in the north Atlantic display different levels of mean condition, which is partly due to the different temperature regimes of their habitats. Cod living in colder waters, e.g. Greenland, Labrador and Grand Bank stocks, were found to be in poorer condition than cod living in warmer waters, e.g. North Sea and Irish Sea stocks. Poor condition causes reduced productivity in terms of slow growth and low recruitment potential. Stocks in better condition display significantly higher weights at age 4 than stocks in poor condition. The a coefficients (function's slopes) obtained from standardised Ricker's recruitment-spawning stock biomass (SSB) relationships were defined as indicators for the recruitment potential of stocks. These a coefficients were found to be positively correlated with the mean condition factor of the 10 stocks analysed. This indicates that stocks consisting of individuals in poor condition appear to be very susceptible to reduced recruitment at low SSB, while the stocks that consist of fish in good condition seem to behave more robustly with a higher probability of good recruitment at low SSB. The positive effect of the cod condition on their reproductive potential generally implies that the stocks in good condition in the temperate regions of the northeast and west Atlantic can sustain higher exploitation rates than stocks in poor condition in the colder regimes of the northwest Atlantic (Greenland, Labrador and Grand Bank). This is confirmed by the positive relationship established between the estimated biological management reference points Fmed and the mean cod condition factors, as well as by the recent status of these stocks. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Understanding how populations respond to changes in climate requires long-term, high-quality datasets, which are rare for marine systems. We estimated the effects of climate warming on cod lengths and length variability using a unique 91-y time series of more than 100,000 individual juvenile cod lengths from surveys that began in 1919 along the Norwegian Skagerrak coast. Using linear mixed-effects models, we accounted for spatial population structure and the nested structure of the survey data to reveal opposite effects of spring and summer warming on juvenile cod lengths. Warm summer temperatures in the coastal Skagerrak have limited juvenile growth. In contrast, warmer springs have resulted in larger juvenile cod, with less variation in lengths within a cohort, possibly because of a temperature-driven contraction in the spring spawning period. A density-dependent reduction in length was evident only at the highest population densities in the time series, which have rarely been observed in the last decade. If temperatures rise because of global warming, nonlinearities in the opposing temperature effects suggest that negative effects of warmer summers will increasingly outweigh positive effects of warmer springs, and the coastal Skagerrak will become ill-suited for Atlantic cod.},

abstract = {Many calcified structures produce periodic growth increments useful for age determination at the annual or daily scale. However, age determination is invariably accompanied by various sources of error, some of which can have a serious effect on age-structured calculations. This review highlights the best available methods for insuring ageing accuracy and quantifying ageing precision, whether in support of large-scale production ageing or a small-scale research project. Included in this review is a critical overview of methods used to initiate and pursue an accurate and controlled ageing program, including (but not limited to) validation of an ageing method. The distinction between validation of absolute age and increment periodicity is emphasized, as is the importance of determining the age of first increment formation. Based on an analysis of 372 papers reporting age validation since 1983, considerable progress has been made in age validation efforts in recent years. Nevertheless, several of the age validation methods which have been used routinely are of dubious value, particularly marginal increment analysis. The two major measures of precision, average percent error and coefficient of variation, are shown to be functionally equivalent, and a conversion factor relating the two is presented. Through use of quality control monitoring, ageing errors are readily detected and quantified; reference collections are the key to both quality control and reduction of costs. Although some level of random ageing error is unavoidable, such error can often be corrected after the fact using statistical (‘ digital sharpening ’) methods.},

abstract = {Fisheries assessment scientists can learn at least three lessons from the collapse of the northern cod off Newfoundland: (1) assessment errors can contribute to overfishing through optimistic long-term forecasts leading to the build-up of overcapacity or through optimistic assessments which lead to TACs being set higher than they should; (2) stock size overestimation is a major risk when commercial catch per effort is used as an abundance trend index, so there is continued need to invest in survey indices of abundance trend no matter what assessment methodology is used; and (3) the risk of recruitment overfishing exists and may be high even for very fecund species like cod. This implies that harvest rate targets should be lower than has often been assumed, especially when stock size assessments are uncertain. In the end the high cost of information for accurate stock assessment may call for an alternative approach to management, involving regulation of exploitation rate via measures such as large-scale closures (refuges) that directly restrict the proportion of fish available to harvest. Development of predictive models for such regulatory options is a major challenge for fisheries assessment science.},

abstract = {The study of biomass size distributions has become an important tool for addressing aquatic ecosystem complexity and the consequences of anthropogenic disturbances. However, it remains unclear how changes in pelagic food web topology affect the biomass size–structure. Employing a dynamic multispecies bioenergetic consumer-resource model, we simulated biomass trajectories over time in 10,000 virtual networks of varying topology to address which food web properties are important in determining size–structure in pelagic systems. The slopes of the normalized biomass size spectra (NBSS) and Pareto’s shape parameter ($\gamma$) of our modeled communities are consistent with theoretically expected values for steady-state systems and empirical values reported for several aquatic ecosystems. We found that the main drivers of the NBSS slope and Pareto’s $\gamma$ were the slope of the relationship between body mass and trophic level, the maximum trophic level of the food web, and the stability of total community biomass. Our analyses showed a clear conservative trend in pelagic community size–structure as demonstrated by the robustness of the NBSS slope and Pareto’s $\gamma$ against most of the topological changes in virtual networks. Nevertheless, these analyses also caution that major disturbances in large-bodied or top-trophic level individuals may disrupt this stable pattern.},

abstract = {This paper describes a fishery model based on sine, rather than age, as ane fundamental population variable. The model's key ingredient is a density function related to numbel. or fish within any given size range. A key assumption is that selectivity in the fishery is determined by size, not age, and that fish can reach recruitment sine at various ages. The theory easily yields moment equations comparable with those obtained recently by Fournier and Doonan; far example, the general moment equation here is derived in a four-line proof. The paper gives detailed reeornrnendations for tailoring the new model to a specific fishery, where model complexity is deter- mined by the available data. The new theory places earlier models of Bleriso and Schnute in the context of generalized cohort analysis, where size-dependent mortality is allowed In particular, the paper identifies a potential problem with these earlier models and proposes a solution. All results are interpreted biologically to provide both conceptual and analytical tools far stock assessment.},

Very nice article. Combines an operating model and
observation error model with a management procedure
for roundfish stock in the North Sea. Shows that in
general the procedures fail to achieve the targets
in the face of noise.},

@article{Smith1998,
abstract = {We present a maximum likelihood procedure for estimating population growth and mortality parameters by simultaneously analysing size frequency and growth increment data. The model uses von Bertalanffy growth with variability among individuals in the two parameters that determine growth rate, and size-dependent mortality. Analyzing growth increments together with size frequencies reduces the statistical confounding of the natural mortality rate with von Bertalanffy’s K parameter. We assume steady-state (constant recruitment) conditions for the size distributions; hence the method does not depend on age modes in the distribution. We evaluate the bias and precision of estimates obtained for growth-dominated distributions typical of the red sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus) in northern California, although the methods and its evaluation could be applied as easily to mortality-dominated or bimodal distributions. The method provides good estimates with sample sizes as low as 200 individuals in a size-dominated or bimodal distributions. Results are robust to random variability in recruitment, measurement error, and sampling selectivity up to the size where about one third of the distribution is affected. Estimation of the fishing mortality rate could require size distributions form both an unharvested and a harvested population. Estimates of growth and mortality rates depend critically on reliable growth data.},
